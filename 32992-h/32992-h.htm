<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN A LONDON SCHOOLROOM</span></h2>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s no good,&#8217; sighed Barbara, looking disconsolately
round the room; &#8216;we shall never
get straight in time. Don&#8217;t you think we had
better leave it, and let Auntie Anna see us as
we really are? She will only be disappointed
afterwards, if we begin by being tidy; and I
don&#8217;t like disappointing people, do you?&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a shout of laughter when she
finished speaking, and Barbara frowned. She
never knew why the boys laughed at her when
she tried to explain her reasons for doing
things, but they always did.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that why you have put on your very
shortest frock?&#8217; asked Wilfred, who was brewing
something in a saucepan over the fire. &#8216;I
believe you think that if Auntie Anna saw you
for the first time in your Sunday frock, she
might suppose you were a nice, proper little
girl, instead of<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara seized the sofa cushion and aimed
it at him threateningly. &#8216;Instead of what?&#8217;
she demanded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>Wilfred was at a disadvantage, owing to his
position as well as to the precious quality of the
liquid in the saucepan; and he felt it wiser to
make terms. &#8216;Well,&#8217; he observed, &#8216;you might
at least have put on a longer frock for the
credit of the family; now, mightn&#8217;t you?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara looked down at her blue serge skirt,
edged with certain rows of white braid that
only made it look shorter; and she gave it a
pull to make it fall a little lower over the slim
black legs that appeared beneath it. &#8216;It&#8217;s not
my fault that I have just come from a gymnastic
class,&#8217; she protested. &#8216;Besides, my Sunday
frock is only two inches longer! What difference
does two inches make, even if we <i>have</i>
got an aunt coming? You&#8217;re so particular,
Wilfred.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Stick to your chemicals, Will, and leave
the Babe alone,&#8217; growled Egbert, who was
trying to read a novel on the sofa and found
the conversation disturbing.</p>

<p>It was not often that the eldest of the family
troubled himself about the disputes of the others,
and Barbara was encouraged to go on. &#8216;Besides,&#8217;
she added, &#8216;there isn&#8217;t time to change
now. Auntie Anna will arrive directly; and
who is going to tidy up the schoolroom if I
don&#8217;t?&#8217;</p>

<p>Certainly, no one responded to her appeal.
Egbert and Wilfred became suddenly and suspiciously
interested in what they were doing,
while the two other boys, who were seated on
the edge of the table, continued to swing their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
legs lazily backwards and forwards without
making an effort to help her. Barbara turned
upon them reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is perfectly horrible of you to sit there
laughing, when a strange aunt and a strange
daughter may be here at any minute!&#8217; she
declared. &#8216;I think <i>you</i> might do something,
Peter.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not much!&#8217; laughed Peter, a tall, broad-shouldered
fellow of fifteen or so. &#8216;It&#8217;s good
for little girls to do things, and keeps them
from growing out of all their clothes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Chuck it, Babs!&#8217; advised the younger of
the two. &#8216;What does it matter whether she
thinks we live in a pig-sty or not?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara looked at them doubtfully, then
picked up a pile of ragged music and staggered
across to the cupboard, shot the music into it,
and closed the door just in time to prevent her
load from recoiling upon her. A derisive
chuckle from the boys on the table greeted
her first attempt at tidying up; but she went
on resolutely.</p>

<p>&#8216;Visitors have no business to come and see
people at a day&#8217;s notice like this,&#8217; she complained,
as she swept a handful of rusty nails,
empty gum bottles, and other evidences of past
occupations into a crowded waste-paper basket.</p>

<p>Christopher stopped laughing as she said
this, and a change crept over his pale, rather
delicate features. &#8216;When the visitor is an
<i>aunt</i>,&#8217; he said with energy, &#8216;a day&#8217;s notice is
more than enough.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>He associated the aunt in question with
certain reforms that had taken place from time
to time in the household; and he had never
forgiven her for inducing their father, just two
years ago, to dismiss the nurse they had all
adored and to send Robin and himself to a
hated day-school. There was no knowing what
innovations they might not be forced to accept,
now that she was going to descend upon them
in person.</p>

<p>Peter chuckled again. Most things to Peter
were an occasion for a chuckle. &#8216;That depends
on the spirit in which she comes,&#8217; he remarked,
and he turned his pockets graphically inside
out. &#8216;An aunt who has a big place in the country,
and can afford to travel about in beastly
holes like Munich and the Italian lakes<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And can pick up other people&#8217;s daughters
and adopt them,&#8217; chimed in Christopher, &#8216;just
because their fathers died fighting in the Soudan
and their mothers died&#8211;how did their mothers
die, Egbert?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Penniless,&#8217; grunted Egbert, in response to
the kick his book had just received. &#8216;That&#8217;s
why the kid got adopted, of course.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; proceeded Peter, putting his pockets
back and nodding wisely, &#8216;if an aunt like that
doesn&#8217;t behave decently to her deserving
nephews<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And niece,&#8217; added Babs from the back of
the sofa, where she had just deposited a bundle
of old schoolbooks.</p>

<p>Peter went on unabashed. &#8216;To her deserving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
nephews and undeserving niece,&#8217; he said,
smiling, &#8216;then she&#8217;ll be an awful old dragon!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s something in that,&#8217; observed Wilfred,
taking the saucepan over to the window
for inspection. &#8216;Perhaps she&#8217;ll give me those
new retorts and things I want for my laboratory&#8211;if
I ever get a laboratory,&#8217; he added with a
sigh.</p>

<p>&#8216;Perhaps she&#8217;ll send me straight to college
without expecting me to grind for a musty old
scholarship,&#8217; said Egbert, condescending to take
a share in the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8216;If she asks me down to Crofts for the shooting,
that will be good enough for me,&#8217; observed
Peter, drawing a long breath of anticipation.</p>

<p>Barbara came slowly into the middle of the
room and stood there, quite unconscious of her
rumpled hair and of the streak of dust that was
smeared across her face. &#8216;I wonder what Auntie
Anna will do for me?&#8217; she murmured, more to
herself than to the others. &#8216;I hope, I do hope
it will be something new and interesting and
beautiful!&#8217;</p>

<p>Christopher overheard her, and roused himself.
He slipped off the table and walked to
his favourite position on the hearthrug, giving
an unnecessary pull to the child&#8217;s hair as he
passed her, which was an attention, however,
that she showed no signs of resenting. Babs
never resented anything that Kit chose to do
to her; besides, she wanted to hear what he
was going to say. Whenever Kit stood like
that, with his back to the fire and his legs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
rather wide apart, he was always going to say
something. The odd thing was, that there was
something so convincing in his way of saying
it that the family generally listened.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t you fret yourselves, any of you,&#8217; he
said decidedly. &#8216;Auntie Anna isn&#8217;t going to
make things pleasant for anybody in this house&#8211;not
she! Hasn&#8217;t she persuaded father to do
whatever she likes, all our lives?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is she going to make him do now,
then?&#8217; asked Wilfred, who did not mean to
give up his dream of a laboratory without a
protest.</p>

<p>&#8216;First of all,&#8217; said Christopher, with an air of
confidence, &#8216;she&#8217;ll see that Egbert has a crammer
next summer holidays; and he&#8217;ll either
have to get that scholarship, or he doesn&#8217;t go
to Oxford at all! She&#8217;ll talk about discipline,
and things like that. Aunts always do talk
about discipline, when it&#8217;s for other people&#8217;s
children.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish you&#8217;d shut up,&#8217; grumbled Egbert,
returning to his book. &#8216;How is a fellow to
read when you&#8217;re making such a clatter?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then there&#8217;s Peter,&#8217; continued Christopher,
calmly. &#8216;Of course she&#8217;ll say he&#8217;s much too
young to be trusted with a gun, though he is
such an overgrown, hulking chap; and why
isn&#8217;t he in the fifth instead of the upper fourth,
at <i>his</i> age?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you know about it, you youngest-but-two?&#8217;
shouted Peter, wrathfully.</p>

<p>Kit peered at him through his spectacles,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
and went on as impudently as ever. He was
never afraid to speak his mind, for none of the
others would have dreamed of laying a finger,
except in fun, on the one brother who was not
strong enough to defend himself; and Kit knew
this, as well as he knew his superiority over
them in the matter of brains. The only wonder
was that the knowledge had not made him a
prig. Perhaps it would have been difficult,
though, in the hurly-burly of the Berkeley
family, for any one to have been a prig.</p>

<p>&#8216;As for Wilfred,&#8217; he resumed, &#8216;she&#8217;ll upset
all his ambitions before he can turn round. Do
you suppose she&#8217;ll encourage his messing about
with things in saucepans, just because he wants
to be a doctor? Not she! She&#8217;ll talk about
some rotten business in the City instead. Aunts
always know millions of places in the City where
they can shove their unwilling nephews.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I say, dry up!&#8217; objected Wilfred, who
was already sufficiently depressed by the discovery
that the brew in the saucepan was not a
success.</p>

<p>&#8216;Then she&#8217;ll pack Robin off to a preparatory
at Brighton&#8211;never knew an aunt yet who
didn&#8217;t want to send you to a preparatory at
Brighton!&#8211;and she&#8217;ll do the same to me, only
she&#8217;ll choose a beastly inferior place, where I
shall be looked after by some <i>woman</i>,&#8217; concluded
Christopher, in a tone of scorn. Then
he caught sight of Barbara, who was still standing
thoughtfully in the middle of the room; and
he shook his head at her pityingly. &#8216;After
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
that, having cleared the house of boys, she&#8217;ll
turn her attention to the Babe,&#8217; he said, and
paused rather abruptly.</p>

<p>Barbara woke up from her reflections with a
start. &#8216;Yes, Kit?&#8217; she said questioningly.
&#8216;What will Auntie Anna do to me?&#8217;</p>

<p>Kit&#8217;s expression of pity became exaggerated.
&#8216;To begin with,&#8217; he said, with a deep sigh,
&#8216;she&#8217;ll let down your frocks, and tie back your
hair, and never let you go anywhere alone, not
even to the pillar-box at the corner!&#8217;</p>

<p>The other boys began to laugh afresh.</p>

<p>&#8216;Think of the Babe with her hair bunched
up on the top, and fastened with a bit of ribbon!
She&#8217;ll look exactly like a French poodle, won&#8217;t
she?&#8217; scoffed Peter.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;ll have to hold up her skirt in the
street, and step in and out of the puddles like
this!&#8217; added Wilfred, taking the end of his coat
between his thumb and finger, and prancing
round Barbara on tiptoe.</p>

<p>Egbert shut up his book, and joined lazily in
the general derision. &#8216;Poor little Babe! will it
have to turn into a young lady, and stop talking
slang, and learn about box-pleats and false hems
and <i>tucks</i>?&#8217; he jeered softly.</p>

<p>Barbara turned her back on the others, and
once more appealed to Christopher. Teasing
was not the kind of thing that roused her;
she had grown accustomed to it, long ago.
&#8216;What else, Kit?&#8217; she demanded impatiently.
&#8216;There&#8217;s something else, isn&#8217;t there?&#8217;</p>

<p>Christopher nodded. &#8216;Yes,&#8217; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
ominously, &#8216;there&#8217;s something else. But I&#8217;m not
going to tell you what it is.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Egbert, stretching himself, &#8216;of
course there&#8217;s something else, Babe. We all
know what it is, but we&#8217;re not going to tell you
either.&#8217;</p>

<p>Babs looked swiftly from one to the other.
&#8216;I know!&#8217; she said, shaking the hair out of her
eyes. &#8216;It&#8217;s&#8211;school!&#8217;</p>

<p>Kit nodded again. &#8216;That swagger place
near Crofts, where the adopted kid has been,&#8217;
he continued in a solemn tone.</p>

<p>The others copied his manner, and looked
at her with a ridiculous pretence of concern.
&#8216;Poor Babe!&#8217; they said in a chorus.</p>

<p>Barbara again shook the hair out of her eyes
with a defiant gesture. Then she spun round
lightly on her toes, and surprised everybody by
laughing scornfully. &#8216;What a fuss you&#8217;re all
making!&#8217; she cried. &#8216;Don&#8217;t you know I am
simply <i>longing</i> to go to school?&#8217;</p>

<p>Judging from their expressions, the Berkeley
boys certainly did not know anything of the
kind. Even Christopher was puzzled at her
curious way of taking his prediction. &#8216;You&#8217;re
putting it on, Babs!&#8217; he said doubtfully.</p>

<p>Barbara stopped spinning round, and faced
them all breathlessly. &#8216;I&#8217;m not, honour
bright!&#8217; she declared. &#8216;I have always wanted
to go to school; I have always longed to have
some real friends of my own, and to be with
people who are not trying all the time to be
funny. You don&#8217;t know how tiring it is to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
scored off from morning till night. I want a
change; I want to do regular, proper lessons,
and to get to the top of the school, and to have
every one looking up to me! Then, they play
games at school, <i>real</i> games, instead of the
stupid ones we play in the square, that only
graze your knees. Girls are nice and jolly and
quiet, and they understand you, and they don&#8217;t
bother you to do things when you&#8217;d sooner
read. Of course I want to go to school, <i>dreadfully</i>!&#8217;</p>

<p>She paused for breath, and Egbert whistled.
&#8216;Well, I&#8217;m bothered!&#8217; he remarked. He had
never pretended to understand his little sister,
but he could not help being astonished at this
totally new side to her character. Peter took
refuge as usual in a laugh; and Wilfred stared
silently. But Kit looked more solemn than ever.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m disappointed in you, Babs,&#8217; he said.
&#8216;I should never have thought that you wanted
to be a young lady, never!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But I don&#8217;t, Kit!&#8217; answered the child in a
troubled tone. &#8216;I want to do something new,
that&#8217;s all. I&#8211;I&#8217;m sure father will understand
what I mean, if he sends me to school,&#8217; she
added, with something that sounded like a
shake in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah&#8211;father!&#8217; replied Christopher, gruffly.
&#8216;Father will not be here, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>A sudden silence came over them; and
Barbara turned to the window and flattened her
nose against the glass pane, and blinked her
eyes with all her might. There was nothing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
be seen outside but the blank wall that usually
limits the view from the back of a London
house; but the child with the untidy brown hair,
and the small impish face, and the slender long
legs, was able, for all that, to see pictures out
there. She always saw pictures when she was
excited about anything; and just now she was
thrilled with a new dream&#8211;a dream of the
place that her imagination named &#8216;school.&#8217;
She had always hidden from the boys how
much she wanted to go to school; and it was
only this afternoon, when their derision provoked
her into it, that she had let them have a
guess at her real feelings. They had not understood
her a bit, as she knew they would not;
but that did not matter. Her father would
understand, though she never told him much,
either, and he had to guess for himself what
went on in the quaint little mind of his only
daughter; but then, Barbara had a shrewd idea
that he always guessed right, and that came to
the same thing, really. Just as she was comforting
herself with this assurance, the miserable
consciousness returned that he was going away,
and she would be left at the mercy of a strange
aunt; and she found herself staring at nothing
but a dismal brick wall, with eyes that were
blinking to keep back the tears.</p>

<p>Peter was the first to break the pause that
had settled with a kind of gloom on the old
London schoolroom. He was always on the
alert to resent anything that cast a shadow
over the light gaiety of existence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>&#8216;I say, look here,&#8217; he began, giving himself
a shake as if to get rid of an unpleasant impression;
&#8216;don&#8217;t be so jolly blue, all of you!
Father will only be away six months; he said
so himself. And as for Auntie Anna, how do
we know she isn&#8217;t quite a decent old lady?
Some old ladies are awfully sporting. Do you
remember Merton major&#8217;s aunt, Will? She used
to give him whopping tips, whenever she came
to see him; and he said he quite liked her!&#8217;</p>

<p>Christopher persisted in his gloomy view of
the situation. &#8216;Our aunt is not the same as
anybody else&#8217;s aunt,&#8217; he said. &#8216;And then,
there&#8217;s the adopted kid.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; admitted Peter, &#8216;no doubt she&#8217;ll be a
trial. Five years at a girls&#8217; school and a year
abroad doesn&#8217;t give anybody a chance, does it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh!&#8217; said Barbara, in a disappointed tone,
&#8216;I did hope <i>she</i> would be nice!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Wonder if she&#8217;ll mind the smell of chemicals,&#8217;
observed Wilfred, sniffing cautiously at
the saucepan he still held in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course she will,&#8217; answered Christopher.
&#8216;She&#8217;ll hate the whole jolly lot of us, because
we&#8217;re boys; and she&#8217;ll disapprove of the Babe.&#8217;</p>

<p>The boys broke into a laugh. There was
something irresistibly funny to them in Christopher&#8217;s
serious way of looking at things. But
Barbara was much too worried over his last
remark to join in the laugh against him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Kit,&#8217; she begged anxiously, &#8216;why is the
adopted kid going to disapprove of me?&#8217;</p>

<p>The air was full of startling discoveries this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
afternoon, and the idea that the &#8216;adopted kid,&#8217;
for whom she had already formed an imaginary
attachment, was not going to like her, was a
great shock to her. But before Kit had time
to speak, a loud ring at the door-bell drove the
words out of his mind and startled the rest of
them into an agitated expectancy.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s her!&#8217; groaned Kit, and he dropped
on the sofa and plunged his head into the cushion,
as if he wanted to stifle even the thought
of the dragon who was coming to work such
havoc in the family. His words were proved
by the sudden arrival of Robin, who had been
posted as scout on the back staircase, and who
now flung himself into their midst. He was in
far too great a hurry to look where he was going;
and he tripped over the saucepan, which
had been set down casually near the door, and
fell full length into the room.</p>

<p>&#8216;Heigh-ho, Bobbin!&#8217; said Peter, cheerily, as
he picked him up again; for, in spite of his
nine years, there was always the chance that
Robin might be going to cry. But, on this
occasion, Robin was too full of news to trouble
himself about possible bruises.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s come; I&#8217;ve seen her!&#8217; he gasped.
&#8216;There&#8217;s a carriage an&#8217; pair, big spanking
chestnuts with red rosettes; and a man&#8211;a
man with pink tops to his boots and a brush at
the side of his hat<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Get on, Bobbin!&#8217; urged Egbert, impatiently.
&#8216;We&#8217;ve all seen a carriage and pair before.
What about the dragon?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>&#8216;Saw her too!&#8217; said Robin, panting for
breath. &#8216;Got a long black silk thing on, and
a bonnet that&#8217;s rather like a hat, with pink
feathers in it, and a walking-stick with a blue
knob to it, an&#8217; white kid gloves,&#8211;no, I mean
grey kid<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, get on, do!&#8217; interrupted Egbert again.
&#8216;Never mind about her clothes, stupid! What
is she <i>like</i>?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s like,&#8217; said Robin, a
little sulkily. &#8216;Couldn&#8217;t see everything from
the back staircase, could I? There was a girl
with her,&#8217; he added, as a concession to the general
curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8216;The adopted kid!&#8217; exclaimed the others in
a chorus.</p>

<p>Babs pressed forward eagerly. &#8216;Does she
look nice, Bobbin? Is she tall or short? Are
her dresses <i>quite</i> long, and is her hair done
up?&#8217; she cried, pouring out her questions in a
jumble.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, yes; her skirts trail all along the ground
for miles,&#8217; answered Robin. &#8216;And she sort of
rustled like tissue paper. Didn&#8217;t see her face,
&#8217;cause it was all tied up in a veil,&#8211;but she&#8217;s
awfully tall,&#8217; he added, looking round the circle
with his head poised on one side. &#8216;She&#8217;s
taller&#8217;n any of us&#8211;even Egbert,&#8217; he concluded
viciously, remembering his recent snubbing.</p>

<p>Egbert put out a long arm, laid the boy dexterously
on the flat of his back in the middle
of the floor, and pinned him there with his foot.
&#8216;Say that&#8217;s a cram!&#8217; he commanded in a stern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
voice. &#8216;Say I&#8217;m a head taller than the adopted
kid, or else I&#8217;ll<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>What he would have done to him remained
unheard, for Robin set up a wail that completely
drowned the end of his sentence. The other
boys only shrugged their shoulders; the thing
seemed to them a necessary incident in the
education of a younger member, and they were
not going to interfere. But Barbara sprang
forward passionately. That was the kind of
thing that did rouse her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Leave him alone, Egbert!&#8217; she cried, but
she did not wait to see whether he would. She
scarcely supposed that he would stop teasing
any one for her; besides, she never stayed to
think, when once anything had roused her. So
she put her head down and made a charge
straight at the offender; and Egbert, being
unprepared for the attack, fell backwards over
the footstool, with his small sister on the top of
him, while Robin wriggled free of them both
and set up a louder howl than before in his
surprise and dismay.</p>

<p>In the middle of the hubbub the door opened;
and a voice, that attracted their attention at
once because it was strange to them, made itself
heard through the tumult.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is there anybody here who is called Babs?&#8217;
asked the new-comer.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>A WITCH IN A STEEPLE-HAT</span></h2>

<p>Barbara picked herself up and looked towards
the door. A girl of about eighteen stood there&#8211;an
exceedingly pretty girl in a pretty frock,
as the Berkeley boys might have noticed if they
had been given to noticing things of this kind.
But her regular features and her pink-and-white
complexion and her reddish-brown hair made
very little impression upon them, and they only
saw that she was dressed in a grown-up manner
that was rather against her than otherwise.
They decided, with the hasty judgment of a
large family, that she was much too grand to be
treated as a companion; and they prepared,
quite unnecessarily, to resent any attempt of
hers to be patronising.</p>

<p>Nothing was further from Jill&#8217;s mind than to
be patronising. She had never patronised any
one in her life, not even the younger children
at school, who always expected to be patronised;
and she was not likely to begin now, with a set
of schoolboys who frightened her out of her
wits. For she had never had anything to do
with boys before, and she had been dreading
this moment ever since her return from abroad.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
She fully expected they would play practical
jokes upon her, as the schoolboys in books always
did; and she was not reassured by the uproar
that met her ears when she opened the schoolroom
door. It was ridiculous that she should
feel shy, after travelling about for a whole year
and meeting all sorts of people; but as she
stood rather helplessly in the doorway, she certainly
found that she was too shy to make the
first advances.</p>

<p>The boys hesitated, and waited for one another
to begin. Egbert, who could not forget
that he had just been rolling on the floor, was
brushing himself down and looking self-conscious;
and it was Christopher who remembered
his manners first and came forward with
his hand out.</p>

<p>&#8216;How do you do?&#8217; he began in his solemn,
precise way. &#8216;Won&#8217;t you come and sit down?
There&#8217;s an arm-chair over here, and a cushion
too&#8211;somewhere. Clear out, can&#8217;t you, Peter?
I believe we can even rise to a footstool, if it
isn&#8217;t lost. You might look for it, Bobbin, instead
of staring like a stuck pig!&#8217; He installed
her in the arm-chair and placed himself in front
of her, slightly bending forward, as he had seen
his father do when there were visitors in the
drawing-room; and although the result was
rather funny when Kit did it, he managed to
make Jill feel a little more at home. &#8216;I suppose
you are Auntie Anna&#8217;s daughter,&#8217; he continued
politely, &#8216;but we don&#8217;t know your name.
I don&#8217;t think we have ever heard it.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>&#8216;I am Jill Urquhart,&#8217; answered the girl. She
swept a glance round at the others, who stood
listening, and made a little gesture of dismay.
&#8216;What a lot there are of you!&#8217; she exclaimed,
without thinking. &#8216;I shall never remember all
your names!&#8217;</p>

<p>It was an unlucky beginning, for they at
once put down her remark to affectation and
counted it against her. They were so used to
their numbers themselves, that they could not
understand any one else being overwhelmed by
them. Peter looked mischievous.</p>

<p>&#8216;It isn&#8217;t so confusing as it looks,&#8217; he hastened
to tell her. &#8216;We all answer to our names, and
you will find us warm-hearted and obedient.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jill glanced at him innocently. &#8216;Why,&#8217; she
said with a little laugh, &#8216;you talk as though you
were all dogs!&#8217;</p>

<p>Peter was left staring, and the others tittered.
By her perfectly natural remark she had turned
the scale in her favour and convinced them that
there was stuff in the &#8216;adopted kid&#8217; after all.
Quite unconscious of having said anything
funny, though, Jill waited till they stopped
laughing, and then turned again to Christopher.
&#8216;Won&#8217;t you introduce me?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>Kit nodded towards Egbert, who had finished
brushing himself down and was waiting to shake
hands. &#8216;That is Egbert, who is just waking
up to the fact that you&#8217;re here,&#8217; he announced.
&#8216;You will find him rather superior, I am afraid,
but we put up with him because of his age and
position. Pass along, please!&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>Egbert shrugged his shoulders good-naturedly.
&#8216;It&#8217;s only Kit&#8217;s way,&#8217; he explained to
Jill; &#8216;everybody gives in to Kit.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jill smiled. &#8216;Kit&#8217;s way&#8217; had made her forget
her shyness, and she was already interested
in the delicate-looking lad, with the thin, clever
face, who had so promptly taken her under his
protection.</p>

<p>&#8216;The next is Wilfred,&#8217; continued Christopher.
&#8216;He is responsible for the unsavoury saucepan
that has just been upset on the carpet. He
thinks he is going to be a doctor, so he is always
making experiments. Of course, he isn&#8217;t
going to be a doctor, really; the house can&#8217;t run
to it; but we let him have his fancies. Then
comes Peter, whom you have just sat upon.
Peter can&#8217;t help being funny, so you must try
and bear with him. There are so few jokes in
this family that perhaps we have encouraged
him more than we should.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Wait till she&#8217;s gone, that&#8217;s all!&#8217; threatened
Peter in a whisper, as he passed by after
shaking hands with Jill. Christopher looked
at him over his spectacles, and went calmly
on.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m next on the list, and my name is Christopher,
changed by the vulgar into Kit,&#8217; he was
proceeding, when Egbert made a spirited
interruption.</p>

<p>&#8216;He is our genius,&#8217; he said, with a flourish of
his hand towards the spokesman. &#8216;We are all
very proud of him, for although only thirteen,
he has the wisdom and intelligence of one twice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
his age. He is the only member of the family
who can spell, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, dry up!&#8217; muttered Kit, but his remonstrance
was drowned in the approving jeers of
the others. The genius had had it all his own
way for about ten minutes, and it was satisfactory
to see him &#8216;scored off&#8217; in his turn. Kit
tried to resume his dignified attitude in front of
Jill, but the attempt was not particularly successful.
It was always impossible in the Berkeley
family to remain dignified for long.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you sure you have got them right so
far, or shall I write them down?&#8217; he asked,
with so much gravity that Jill looked at him
rather suspiciously. He met her glance through
his spectacles without wincing, and the others
tittered again. They were still a little doubtful
about this new cousin of theirs, who was so unlike
any one who had come their way before;
and it was rather a relief to pretend to be
amused.</p>

<p>&#8216;The last of the boys is Robin, or Bobbin if
you prefer it,&#8217; continued Kit, glibly. &#8216;He is the
youngest of us all, and the most ill-used. Indeed,
when you came in just now, you may have
seen the Babe trying to rescue him. That reminds
me! I have left out our only girl. She
comes between me and Bobbin, and here you
may perceive her&#8211;the Babe!&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara came slowly round from her hiding-place
at the back of the sofa, and stood face to
face with Jill. There was rather a wistful look
on the small countenance just then; for in all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
her dreams of the wonderful cousin who was
going to be her first girl-friend, Babs had never
imagined anything like this grown-up, elegant
creature, who did her hair like the ladies in the
park and wore her watch dangling from her
wrist. The child&#8217;s heart sank as she suddenly
thought of her short gymnastic frock, and her
rumpled hair, and her dirty hands. As for Jill,
she stared down at the little person in front of
her, and could not help smiling. Whenever
she had particularly dreaded being plunged
into this family of boys, she had always consoled
herself by remembering that there would
be one girl among them to take her part.
Now, as she looked at the rough little tomboy
before her, with her elf-like face and figure, and
her bright eager eyes, she had to own again to
herself that a large family was a difficult thing
to understand.</p>

<p>&#8216;So you are Babs,&#8217; she began, not knowing
what else to say. Then she remembered her
errand, and added hastily, &#8216;Will you please go
and see mother? She is in the library with
Uncle Everard.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara escaped and sped along the hall, full
of relief at having got away from the uncomfortable
grown-up feeling that seemed to have
come into the schoolroom with Jill. She even
paused outside the library door, in her quaint,
inconsequent way, to ask herself why Jill
seemed so much more grown-up than the nice
old gentlemen who came to see her father, with
their pockets full of chocolates for her; and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
supposed it was because they were really old,
while Jill was only grown-up, which was far
more alarming because it was so much more
mysterious. But hardly had she settled this
question in her mind than a fresh one presented
itself to her. How was she to know that this
other stranger, who was waiting in there to see
her, was not also going to stare at her and smile,
as Jill had done? Babs gave a troubled sigh,
and opened the door with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>A little old lady sat on the sofa beside her
father, with her hand in his. She was not
beautiful by any means; her back was bent&#8211;like
an old witch&#8217;s, Barbara thought&#8211;and she
had a nose that might have been described as
hooked, and a mouth that turned down at the
corners and gave her almost a sour expression.
But she had two small, keen black eyes, that
took all the ugliness out of her face; sometimes
they shone and sometimes they softened,
but more often still they twinkled, as they did
now, when her little niece stole timidly into the
room. The moment the child looked up and
met those eyes, she felt she was looking at her
father&#8217;s sister. If she had but known it, the
same eyes, too, were gleaming back at the old
lady from the middle of a bush of tangled brown
hair.</p>

<p>&#8216;So this is your tomboy, is it?&#8217; said Mrs. Crofton,
bluntly. &#8216;Come here, child, and don&#8217;t stand
shivering there. Do you think I am going to
do anything to you?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara&#8217;s unusual timidity vanished at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
sound of that voice. It was sharp and abrupt
and determined, but it rang true, and there was
nothing in it to frighten anybody.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not afraid,&#8217; she said, returning the old
lady&#8217;s gaze frankly; &#8216;I am hardly ever afraid
of people. Am I, father?&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Berkeley chuckled in an amused manner.
He had been very curious to see this meeting
between his wild little daughter and the sister
who had managed his domestic affairs for him
since the death of his wife. By nature a student,
he lived most of his life in his library and
in himself, and only woke up now and then to
the fact that he had six growing children, who
probably needed something besides the affection
it was so easy to give them. In these
waking moments he would write off to his
sister, Mrs. Crofton of Crofts, for whose judgment
he had quite a pathetic regard, and would
carry out to the letter every suggestion she
chose to send him. Only once had he ignored
her advice, and that was when she had proposed
a governess for Barbara; for he had passed
over this idea in silence, and the child had continued
to run in and out of his library, reading
what books she pleased, and ordering her own
upbringing in a way that seemed to him eminently
satisfactory. For that matter, his library
was open to any of his children at any time
that they chose to invade it; and they interrupted
him fearlessly as often as they pleased,
without provoking anything worse than a good-humoured
growl from him, that was never to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
taken seriously for a moment. Probably this
was why the tie between them and their father
had come to be a friendly as well as an affectionate
one.</p>

<p>Just lately, something had happened to change
the haphazard course of affairs in the old London
house. That autumn, Mr. Berkeley had
brought out a philosophical work on which he
had been engaged for years, and although it
had only had a limited success in England,
it had made a great sensation in America. The
result was an invitation to conduct a lecturing
tour in the States, which would take him abroad
for something like half a year. Mr. Berkeley
had the vaguest notions as to the amount of
protection his children needed, but he had a
sort of idea that children left in charge of a
housekeeper would be considered neglected,
and he did not want his children to feel neglected.
As usual, he referred his dilemma to
Mrs. Crofton, who replied promptly from the
Riviera, saying she was on her way home to
Crofts, and would stop a week in town to settle
his affairs for him. This he forgot to mention
to the children until the day she was to arrive,
and then, in his innocence, considered their
dismay as one of the peculiarities of youth.</p>

<p>&#8216;So you are not afraid of me, eh? Then
why won&#8217;t you give me a kiss, I should like to
know?&#8217; demanded Auntie Anna, as Barbara
held out her hand in a boyish fashion.</p>

<p>The child looked surprised, and offered an
unwilling cheek. &#8216;We don&#8217;t often kiss in our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
family,&#8217; she explained; &#8216;only when the boys
go back to school, or when somebody has
banged somebody else on the head, or when
it&#8217;s a birthday and presents. But that isn&#8217;t
often, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mrs. Crofton of Crofts smiled, and her brother
pulled his daughter down between them on the
sofa.</p>

<p>&#8216;You must forgive her appearance,&#8217; he said
apologetically. &#8216;We haven&#8217;t anybody to teach
us to be ladylike, have we, Babs?&#8217;</p>

<p>The old lady put her finger under Barbara&#8217;s
chin, and turned the small face round, and
looked into it keenly. &#8216;What&#8217;s the matter with
her appearance?&#8217; she inquired quickly. &#8216;Don&#8217;t
be a goose, Everard! Now, child, tell me!
Do you want to go on being a boy for ever,
reading all sorts of books you have no business
to read, and banging people on the head when
they offend you, and looking alarming old ladies
in the face without flinching; or do you want
to be combed and brushed and smoothed into a
young lady, and taught to rave about art and
music and poetry, and told to look down when
you are spoken to, and never to answer back if
the truth is unpleasant? Hey? Which is it
to be?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara was looking puzzled. &#8216;I don&#8217;t think
I know what you mean,&#8217; she said. &#8216;Do you
mean that I <i>must</i> be either me or&#8211;or Jill?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, supposing we put it that way,&#8217; replied
Mrs. Crofton, smiling again. &#8216;Which do you
choose to be?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>Barbara did not stop to think about it. &#8216;I
don&#8217;t want to be either, thank you,&#8217; she said
decidedly. &#8216;I would <i>much</i> rather be like you
or father.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Berkeley chuckled once more, and his
sister struck her cane on the ground and laughed
heartily. &#8216;A pretty mess you&#8217;ve made of your
daughter&#8217;s education, I must say,&#8217; she remarked.
Then she turned again to Babs. &#8216;Well, child,
I see you are going to be like your father in any
case; and as for me&#8211;well, we&#8217;ll see if we can&#8217;t
prevent such a terrible result as that. And
now, I want you to pretend that I am a fairy
godmother. Do you think you can?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara nodded, and her small black eyes
glistened. It was not difficult to do that.
Already the bonnet with the pink feathers had
turned into a steeple-hat, and the black silk
mantle into a scarlet cloak, and the blue-knobbed
cane into a broomstick. The little
impish face was aglow with delight as the old
lady went on:</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, I&#8217;ve just come down the chimney with
a bang, and I am going to give my goddaughter
the wish that she wishes most in all the world.
But mind&#8211;if I have a suspicion that what she
asks for is not what she really wants&#8211;bang!
up the chimney I go again!&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara took a flying leap into the middle
of the room, and spun round with her favourite
movement on the tips of her toes. Her heart
was thumping wildly with excitement at finding
herself in the middle of a real fairy story; and
when she at last stood still again, she was
almost too breathless to speak.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i1'></a><img src='images/illus-027.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8216;May I&#8211;may I have all that?&#8217;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>&#8216;Please,&#8217; she said, clasping her hands tightly
together, &#8216;I want to go to school, a real girls&#8217;
school, where there are crowds of girls, and
crowds of lessons, and crowds of story-books
with nice endings, and crowds of awfully jolly
games that don&#8217;t pull your hair about and don&#8217;t
give you bruises. May I&#8211;may I have all
that?&#8217;</p>

<p>Auntie Anna once more struck her cane
upon the ground. &#8216;That shows how much you
know about your own daughter, Everard!&#8217;
she said, which was a remark that Barbara
never understood. &#8216;You may have all that,
little goddaughter, every bit of it!&#8217; she announced
to the expectant child; &#8216;and what is
more, you shall have it in a week&#8217;s time. Hey-day!
Where are you off to in such a hurry, if
you please, and why am I allowed a kiss all at
once, eh? It isn&#8217;t a birthday, is it?&#8217;</p>

<p>For Barbara had rushed impetuously to the
door, and then scampered back to kiss the face
with the hooked nose that peered out from
beneath the steeple-hat. &#8216;Of course I kissed
you,&#8217; she cried, &#8216;because&#8211;because you&#8217;re such
a brick, you see!&#8217; She paused half-way in her
second journey to the door, and looked back
doubtfully at the old lady on the sofa. &#8216;May I
ask you something else?&#8217; she said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Anything you please,&#8217; answered Auntie Anna.
&#8216;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here for; eh, Everard?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then&#8211;then&#8211;are you going to do anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
for the boys too?&#8217; stammered Barbara. &#8216;I&#8211;I
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s quite fair to keep all the niceness
to myself, you see!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That depends on what the boys want,&#8217;
replied the old lady, gravely. &#8216;Do you think
you can give me any idea?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara puckered up her eyebrows, and
counted off the names on her fingers. &#8216;First
there&#8217;s Egbert,&#8217; she began; &#8216;he wants to go to
Oxford without having to get a scholarship
first. Then there&#8217;s Wilfred; he wants to be a
doctor, but Kit says there isn&#8217;t money enough
and he&#8217;s got to get over it. Do you think
you&#8217;ll be able to make Will into a doctor?
And Peter wants lots of shooting; he says he
doesn&#8217;t mind about anything else, only Kit says
he isn&#8217;t old enough, and you won&#8217;t trust him
with a gun. Kit hasn&#8217;t seen you yet, you see.
Then there&#8217;s Kit<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s enough for the present!&#8217; cried Mrs.
Crofton, who was leaning back, convulsed
with laughter, among the sofa cushions. Mr.
Berkeley again drew his daughter towards
him.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are revealing all the secrets of the
prison-house, little girl,&#8217; he remarked.</p>

<p>Barbara looked from one to the other.
&#8216;Auntie Anna did ask me,&#8217; she said reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8216;To be sure I did,&#8217; answered the old lady,
recovering herself with an effort, &#8216;and I am
delighted to hear some of the things I am
expected to do. But you must allow that even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
a fairy godmother has a hard time of it occasionally,
and it is a little difficult to provide
for all her godchildren at once, you know.
However, you shall hear what is going to
happen in a week&#8217;s time, on the very day that
this naughty father of yours takes himself off
to America; and if you approve of it, we can
see about the other things later on. Is that a
bargain, eh?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh! What else is going to happen in a
week&#8217;s time?&#8217; asked Barbara, eagerly. By this
time she was prepared for any dream to come
true. Her faith in the old lady who was playing
at fairy stories was complete.</p>

<p>Mr. Berkeley answered her. &#8216;Auntie Anna
is going to carry you all off to Crofts for the
whole six months that I am away,&#8217; he told her;
&#8216;and you are going to Jill&#8217;s school at Wootton
Beeches, which is only ten miles off. So Kit
and Robin will be able to come over and see
you sometimes, when the others have gone
away, for they are going to have a tutor and
stay at Crofts with Auntie Anna and Jill.
Isn&#8217;t that a fine idea?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara was speechless with rapture. The
expression on her face made them laugh once
more. Then she gave a kind of war-whoop
that might have been heard in the schoolroom,
and bounded again towards the door. &#8216;I
simply can&#8217;t bear it another minute,&#8217; she gasped.
&#8216;I <i>must</i> go and tell the boys.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bear it just one more minute, and hear
what else I have to say,&#8217; begged Auntie Anna,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
raising herself with the help of her stick, and
walking slowly after her excited little niece.
&#8216;Can you ride bicycles, all of you?&#8217;</p>

<p>The child shook her head. &#8216;Only Egbert,&#8217;
she said; &#8216;and that is because he stayed with
a chap, last holidays, who lent him one. Bicycles
are too jolly expensive for this family,
you know,&#8217; she added quaintly.</p>

<p>Auntie Anna stood still and pointed the
blue-knobbed cane impressively at the child,
who stood waiting. &#8216;What do you say to a
bicycle apiece all round,&#8217; she began, &#8216;and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>But Barbara did not wait to say anything.
Back along the hall she scampered with all her
might, and flung herself panting into the schoolroom.
She burst out at once with a rapturous
medley of news.</p>

<p>&#8216;Boys, boys!&#8217; she shouted at the top of her
voice; &#8216;the dragon isn&#8217;t a dragon, she&#8217;s like a
fairy godmother out of a story-book! And
she&#8217;s going to send me to the adopted kid&#8217;s
school, and everybody is going to live at Crofts
till father comes back, and there&#8217;s going to be
bicycles <i>all round</i>&#8211;no waiting &#8217;cause you&#8217;re
the youngest, Bobbin!&#8211;and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>Suddenly she paused and stammered, and
paused again. Finally, she stood silent and
uncomfortable, with the excitement and the
thrill all gone out of her. She had quite forgotten
Jill; and Jill, enthroned in the one arm-chair,
with the one cushion at her back and the
one footstool at her feet, was looking as though
she was not there to be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>&#8216;I&#8217;ve just been telling the boys all about it,&#8217;
she remarked.</p>

<p>Barbara stared. It put the finishing touch
to her distrust of Jill, that she should have told
anything to the boys&#8211;<i>her</i> boys&#8211;before she
had time to tell them herself.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8211;I think it&#8217;s a shame!&#8217; she exclaimed
hotly, and she bit her lip to keep from crying.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hullo, Babe! What&#8217;s up?&#8217; asked Peter, in
surprise.</p>

<p>Jill slipped out of the arm-chair, and laid her
hand on the child&#8217;s shoulder. &#8216;I&#8217;m so sorry,
Babs,&#8217; she began softly; &#8216;I really didn&#8217;t
know<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara looked up at her doubtfully. The
tone was kind, but then, why did she go on
smiling in that irritating way? &#8216;You don&#8217;t
understand,&#8217; she said, and twisted herself free
from Jill&#8217;s grasp, and did not speak again until
she was gone.</p>

<p>The boys took no notice of her; they always
left the Babe alone when she was in one of her
odd moods. But Jill, who had really meant to
be kind, went away feeling puzzled. She had
got over her first shyness of the boys in a very
few minutes, for they were evidently trying to
be friendly in their blunt, boyish fashion; but
Barbara baffled her. There was something
antagonistic in the child&#8217;s manner; and Jill,
who had always been accustomed to meeting
with affection wherever she went, did not quite
know what to make of her. Of course it was
ridiculous to worry herself about a tomboy of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
eleven who chose to be sulky; but it was the
first time any one had refused to make friends
with her, and Jill was a little hurt about it.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re spoiled, my dear,&#8217; remarked her
mother, as they drove away from the Berkeleys&#8217;
house; &#8216;and it is I who have spoiled you.
I&#8217;m a silly old woman, but I never could bear
to deny you all the sympathy you asked. I
was afraid, you see, that you might think the
world was not a nice place to be in.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m glad you spoiled me, and I think the
world <i>is</i> a nice place to be in,&#8217; answered Jill,
laughing. &#8216;But what has that to do with
Barbara&#8217;s not liking me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, you can&#8217;t expect every one to like
you,&#8217; said the old lady, in her brusque way.
&#8216;Babs will like you well enough when she finds
that she is still the Babe of the family, in spite
of your being there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But&#8211;but I don&#8217;t like to feel that there is
anybody anywhere who doesn&#8217;t like me,&#8217; complained
Jill, with a little pout.</p>

<p>&#8216;No more does the Babe, I expect,&#8217; said
Mrs. Crofton, smiling. &#8216;However, do your
best to understand the poor little soul; she has
not had much spoiling, and I should like you
two to be friends.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh!&#8217; cried Jill, laughing again as she
recalled the funny little figure that had come
bounding into the schoolroom with such a yell
and a clatter. &#8216;But she really is rather impossible,
mother dear!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Quite,&#8217; responded the old lady, drily; &#8216;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
she has amazing possibilities, and I thought
you might perhaps like to find them. Well,
what about the others?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I like them,&#8217; said Jill; &#8216;though I wish
they would not all talk at once; it&#8217;s so confusing.
And I&#8217;m a little afraid of them, too. You
never know why they are laughing at you; and
if you take them seriously, they laugh more than
ever. Whatever you do, they laugh.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Large families are always like that,&#8217; chuckled
Mrs. Crofton.</p>

<p>&#8216;Large families are rather exhausting then,
aren&#8217;t they?&#8217; said Jill. &#8216;The boys are rather
rough too, and they seem so proud of having
scars on their hands, and of being able to see a
pig killed without feeling bad&#8211;at least, Peter
was. Kit is different from the others: I like
Kit. And they <i>are</i> frank! They were not
ashamed of calling me the &#8220;adopted kid&#8221; to
my face; and they even owned to having nicknamed
you &#8220;the dragon&#8221;!&#8217;</p>

<p>The old lady laughed. &#8216;So I am, as far as
they know!&#8217; she replied. Then she patted the
girl caressingly on the hand. &#8216;My dear, it does
us all good to be with people who are frank,
even if they are a little rough with it. And I
want you to help me to put as much love and
gentleness as we can into the Berkeleys&#8217; lives,
for it strikes me that spoiling is what this large
family wants.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then it&#8217;s what this large family will certainly
get, if <i>you</i> have anything to do with it,&#8217;
answered Jill, softly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>In the schoolroom they had just left, the
criticisms were brief and to the point.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;ll do,&#8217; said Peter, condescendingly, &#8216;when
she&#8217;s got over that silly way of gaping at us, as
though we were beasts at the Zoo.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s stunning to look at, and her clothes
are just ripping,&#8217; said Egbert, the eldest; &#8216;but,
of course, you kids couldn&#8217;t be expected to
notice that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, you think you&#8217;re everybody, just because
you stayed with a chap last holidays who had a
grown-up sister who called you <i>Mr.</i> Berkeley,&#8217;
cried Wilfred.</p>

<p>Robin said he liked her soft way of speaking,
and she reminded him of Nurse, which set them
all laughing, as they recalled that homely-looking
person in cap and spectacles. Christopher
put in his opinion, when they had all had their
say.</p>

<p>&#8216;She wants knowing,&#8217; he said briefly.
&#8216;There&#8217;s too many of us in a lump to let her
give herself away. When she takes us separately,
or in pairs, we shall get on as right as
rain. And she really does know something
about stamps.&#8217;</p>

<p>But the Babe, who sat away in a corner by
herself, said nothing. She had forgotten Jill
for the moment, forgotten her own fit of
jealousy and her shyness of the interloper, and
she did not even hear what the others were
talking about. She was going to school at last,
and nothing else was of any consequence. Indeed,
all through the week of whirl and preparation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
that followed, Barbara went about in a kind
of dream. She could hardly yet believe in her
good luck. A few short days ago things had
seemed likely to go on for ever in the same
uneventful way, except that they were going to
be made dreary for a time by the absence of
the father she adored; and now, just through
the coming of an old lady, whom she had been
prepared to hate, this amazing change in her
future was going to take place. To an imaginative
little person like Barbara, it was useless
to pretend that there was nothing out of the
ordinary in this. She had lived for years in a
fairy world of her own, where Kit was a fairy
prince and her father a nice old magician, and
where numbers of charming princesses, the
schoolgirls of her imagination, were ready to
sympathise with her whenever the boys had
been teasing her more than usual. It was
surely to this kingdom of her fancy that a
fairy godmother, who had once been a dragon,
properly belonged; and all through that week,
Barbara wandered in her imaginary kingdom
with this new inhabitant of it, pointing out all
its beauties to her, and even assuring her that
the magician would cure her rheumatism if she
were to ask him nicely. &#8216;Only, you must not
make her back <i>quite</i> straight,&#8217; she whispered privately
to the magician, &#8216;because she wouldn&#8217;t
be a proper fairy godmother if her back were
straight!&#8217; She also added strict injunctions to
the keeper of her gates, that a certain grown-up
cousin, who might be known by her tiresome way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
of smiling at people, was not to be admitted under
any circumstances into her fairy kingdom. &#8216;It
would never do,&#8217; thought Barbara, seriously,
&#8216;to have any one in my kingdom who wanted
to laugh at me.&#8217;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the busy preparations went on
around her. It was not an easy thing to move
a family of six from the home in which they
had passed the whole of their lives, especially
when their aunt, in the large manner which
characterised everything she did, insisted on
allowing them to pack whatever they wished.</p>

<p>&#8216;We are only young once,&#8217; she represented
to a distracted housekeeper, &#8216;and possessions
are very precious when we are young. Let
them bring everything that will help to make
the place seem like home to them; there is
plenty of room at Crofts. Get tired of the
things? Of course they will! We can&#8217;t expect
them to be wiser than the grown-ups, can
we?&#8217;</p>

<p>So Wilfred packed explosive liquids in
bottles, and Peter packed cricket stumps and
hockey clubs, and Christopher found room
among Egbert&#8217;s collars and ties to stow away
microscope-slides and setting-boards and birds&#8217;
eggs, and Robin brought innumerable contributions
in the shape of torn picture-books and
old toys that the others had discarded long ago.
None of them ever forgot that last week in
their London home; for besides the exquisite
joys of packing up, there were also delightful
expeditions up to town with Auntie Anna,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
ostensibly to buy clothes, but in reality to
afford amusement to an old lady who had
never enjoyed her life so much before; and
whether they went alone with her, or in such
numbers that the brougham was as full as it
could be, the afternoon always ended with a
magnificent tea without limitations&#8211;&#8216;Even
ices to finish up with, and no one saying
nothink about your makin&#8217; yourself ill &#8217;cause
you mixed things!&#8217; as Robin proclaimed on
his return home from one of these expeditions.</p>

<p>Then there was the buying of the six bicycles;
and even Barbara forgot for the moment all about
school and everything else for the sake of her
new two-wheeled possession, soon to be invested
in her mind with magic properties and converted
into a fairy messenger in her fairy kingdom.
She was less patient over the purchase of her
school outfit, which kept her standing at the
dressmaker&#8217;s for whole half-hours together, when
she might have been trying her bicycle round
the square; and she wondered why it was necessary
to have such quantities of clothes, just
because she was going to live at school instead
of at home. Surely, if her present wardrobe
was good enough to pass the critical examination
of five brothers, it need not be improved
to meet the friendly gaze of a parcel of girls!
However, Auntie Anna insisted on more clothes;
and Auntie Anna was a witch, so she ought to
know. And since she did not take the dressmaker&#8217;s
part, but even allowed Barbara to have
her own way as to the shortness of her skirts,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
with an added inch or so to satisfy the scruples
of the dressmaker, it was impossible to grumble
very much at the precious time that was being
wasted.</p>

<p>So the week drew swiftly to a close, and the
day of departure came at last.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>BARBARA&#8217;S DREAM</span></h2>

<p>Once more, Kit stood with his back to the
fireplace, and prepared to address the family.
It was just half an hour after Mr. Berkeley had
left, and they were all assembled rather sorrowfully
in the old schoolroom. In another ten
minutes their own cabs would be at the door,
and they too would be on their way to a new
life. Altogether, it was a solemn moment, and
the genius of the family could not resist the
temptation to make a speech.</p>

<p>&#8216;Boys,&#8217; he began, nodding his head with mock
importance, &#8216;it is my opinion that Auntie Anna
is a jolly wise old lady!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s that to do with father going away?&#8217;
asked Barbara, rubbing her eyes furiously. She
had had her cry on the back staircase, and she
felt safe for the moment against a further display
of weakness.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s got a lot to do with it,&#8217; rejoined Kit.
&#8216;Didn&#8217;t she take us all to the pantomime, last
night&#8211;father, too? I suppose you think that
was just to amuse herself, don&#8217;t you? Well, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
wasn&#8217;t. It was because she was afraid of our
sitting together at home, and saying it was
father&#8217;s last evening, and&#8211;<i>blubbing</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>This he said severely, looking at the weaker
members, Babs and Robin, as he spoke. They
bore the test heroically, and the orator went on.</p>

<p>&#8216;And why,&#8217; he inquired, &#8216;did she give us
only a week to pack up, and buy clothes and
things, when there&#8217;s ten days more before you
other chaps go back? Of course there&#8217;s the
Babe&#8217;s school, but that could have waited.
Girls&#8217; schools never matter.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, <i>why</i>, most precocious of kids?&#8217; asked
Egbert, with lazy tolerance. Certainly, no one
but Christopher would have been allowed to
say so much uninterrupted. But then, even
Egbert had a kind of secret admiration for
his clever young brother, though he did not
pretend to understand him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; continued Christopher, &#8216;if we&#8217;d had
more time to think about it, we might not
have been so keen on going to live in another
person&#8217;s house. And, naturally, Auntie
Anna didn&#8217;t want any ructions over it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, stop it, Kit! What a lot of rot you
are making up!&#8217; objected Peter, impatiently.
Of the three elder boys, he was nearest in age
to Kit, and was consequently less inclined to
tolerate him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Everything points to it, if you&#8217;re not too
thick-headed to see,&#8217; retorted Kit, crushingly.
&#8216;Look at the way we&#8217;re being rushed out of
the house, directly father has turned his back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
Isn&#8217;t that to give us something to think about,
so that we shouldn&#8217;t mope about the shop, and
<i>fancy</i> ourselves? Of course,&#8217; he added blandly,
fixing his spectacles on his nose and staring at
Peter, &#8216;<i>some</i> people don&#8217;t need anything to set
them grinning again.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Christopher, my son, you are a clever child,
but your impudence simply isn&#8217;t to be borne,&#8217;
said Peter; and he stooped down and lifted the
fragile figure of the orator high in the air, and
set him down lightly outside the door. Kit
rearranged his tie, put his spectacles straight,
and peered up at the unappreciative listener
who towered above him.</p>

<p>&#8216;As I was saying,&#8217; he resumed gently,
&#8216;Auntie Anna can give us all points when it
comes to being &#8217;cute.&#8217;</p>

<p>The next day or two proved the truth of
what, in his shrewd way, he had already guessed
for himself. Yet the Berkeleys were hardly to
be called unfeeling, because they appeared to
take their father&#8217;s departure so coolly; for it
would have been difficult to remain unhappy
long, when there were so many delightful things
to distract them. Besides their excitement,
town-bred as they were, at finding themselves
in a real country-house, with an oak staircase, a
secret room, and a ghost story, there were separate
joys waiting for each one of them as well.
There was a horse for Egbert to ride to hounds,
and a well-stocked library for Christopher to
bury himself in, and a lumber-room for Wilfred
to turn into a laboratory; while Peter was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
allowed, the very first day, to go out shooting
with the keepers, and Robin promptly became
the pet of all the men on the estate, and spent
long, happy hours with them down at the
stables and the farm. If there was any one in
the family who was not perfectly content, it was
Barbara.</p>

<p>No doubt, she would have been quite as absorbed
as the others were in their new home, if
she had not been going to another one herself
the very next day. As it was, she found it a
little difficult to share their enthusiasm since
she had a private enthusiasm of her own. But
the boys did not understand this at all. They
were very affectionate to her in their rough,
undemonstrative way, and they were always
telling her that she would be sure to &#8216;pull
through all right&#8217;; for they naturally supposed
that she wanted the kind of pity they wanted so
much themselves at the stated, horrible periods
when they went back to school. But as to
grasping her notion that she was going to enjoy
life at Wootton Beeches, that was not to be
expected of them. So Barbara felt that her
interests, for the first time in her life, were not
the same as theirs; and a queer sort of feeling
crept over her, that changes&#8211;even nice, interesting
changes&#8211;occasionally had something
strange and uncomfortable about them. She
grew so perplexed over it, at last, that she even
went to Jill for sympathy. Jill was at least a
girl, and Jill had been to school, in the same
delightful place to which she was going on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
morrow; and Jill at least ought to know
whether the boys&#8217; idea of school was right or
wrong. So, just after tea, on her last evening
at Crofts, the child swallowed her natural distrust
of her cousin, which, after all, had arisen
chiefly from their mutual shyness of each other,
and started in search of her.</p>

<p>Jill was in the conservatory, arranging the
flowers for the dinner-table; and Barbara&#8217;s shyness
returned, as the trim, neat figure came
walking towards her, along the rows of chrysanthemums.
She glanced down at her crumpled
pinafore and sighed desperately. Being
dragged up a dusty ladder into a cobwebby
lumber-room by Wilfred had not proved the
best of treatments for a pinafore that really had
been clean a couple of hours ago. But Jill suddenly
came out in a new light. With no teasing
schoolboys to overhear her, she felt that
here, at last, was a chance of making friends
with her odd little tomboy of a cousin.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you come to help me with the
flowers?&#8217; she asked, with such a friendly smile,
that Babs cheered up at once. She forgot all
about her crumpled pinafore, and went straight
to the point.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, I didn&#8217;t come for that,&#8217; she answered
simply. &#8216;I came to ask you about&#8211;about
school.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; said Jill, suddenly picking chrysanthemums
at a great rate. &#8216;Supposing you tell me
what you think about it yourself?&#8217;</p>

<p>Her mother&#8217;s words were running in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
head: &#8216;Do your best to understand the poor
little soul!&#8217; and Jill wondered what she could
tell her that would not upset her notions of
school too cruelly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, well,&#8217; replied Babs, &#8216;of course, <i>I</i> think
it&#8217;s going to be beautiful; but the boys&#8211;the
boys are so funny about it, and it&#8217;s made me
all in a muddle inside. Do you think the boys
<i>know</i>?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Perhaps not,&#8217; said Jill, and she strolled
away along the rows of chrysanthemums. It
seemed a shame to spoil the child&#8217;s illusion;
and yet, when she thought of this quaint little
untrained object being dropped in the middle
of the girls at Wootton Beeches<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>Barbara had followed her up closely, and she
suddenly interrupted her reflections. &#8216;You
know what a girls&#8217; school is like, don&#8217;t you,
Jill?&#8217; she continued appealingly. &#8216;I wish&#8211;I
<i>do</i> wish you would tell the boys they are all
wrong about it. They <i>are</i> wrong, aren&#8217;t they?&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a suspicion of a doubt in the last
words that struck Jill as being rather pathetic.
She put her bunch of chrysanthemums down,
and drew Barbara towards her. &#8216;You see,
Babs, it is like this,&#8217; she said slowly; &#8216;school is
very nice, if you do not mind things being
strange at first, and if you can bear being
laughed at, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, that is quite easy!&#8217; interrupted Babs,
with a smile. &#8216;The boys have teased me
always.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Jill, doubtfully; &#8216;the boys have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
teased you; but that is not quite the same
thing. Girls&#8211;girls are not boys, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh no, I know they&#8217;re not!&#8217; replied Barbara,
happily. &#8216;Girls are quiet and kind and gentle;
and they always understand you, and they are
ready to make friends directly they see you. I
think I know what <i>girls</i> are like.&#8217;</p>

<p>She was thinking of the princesses in her
fairy kingdom; and another little smile flickered
across her face. Jill glanced at her for a
moment, and then suddenly made up her mind
how to act.</p>

<p>&#8216;Look here, Babs,&#8217; she began, smoothing the
mop of tangled hair with her hands; &#8216;you go
on thinking that girls are like that, and you&#8217;ll
get along all right!&#8217; Barbara wriggled away
from her before she had time to say any more,
gave her a swift look and a smile of gratitude,
and darted off in search of the boys. &#8216;They&#8217;ll
be very stupid if they don&#8217;t see what a babe it
is,&#8217; added Jill to herself.</p>

<p>At the door of the conservatory, however, the
small figure in the crumpled pinafore came to
a sudden standstill.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, Jill,&#8217; the child blurted out, and she
clutched a handful of pinafore to give herself
courage; &#8216;I&#8211;I want to tell you something.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you?&#8217; said Jill, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8216;I want to explain that I hated you at first,
because I thought you were going to make the
boys like you better than me,&#8217; Babs went on
breathlessly. &#8216;And you frightened me too,
because you laughed in such a funny way, just
as if you were sneering at me for being in a
muck. I thought, perhaps, it was because you
were so grand, and your clothes were so grand,
and all that; but I couldn&#8217;t help being in a
muck, because I always am in a muck, you see;
and so, you see&#8211;you see<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i2'></a><img src='images/illus-045.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8216;Look here Babs,&#8217; she began, smoothing the mop of tangled hair
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>&#8216;I see,&#8217; said Jill, quietly; and she looked
quite thoughtful for a minute or two. Babs
came a step nearer.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t hate you now,&#8217; she said frankly.
&#8216;For one thing, the boys don&#8217;t like you better
than me, after all. They don&#8217;t even like you
so much as they thought they were going to.
But <i>I</i> think you&#8217;re awfully nice,&#8211;almost as
nice as Kit and Nurse and father,&#8211;and I
shall go and tell them so, now; and then, perhaps,
they won&#8217;t say you are young-ladyish any
more!&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a vision of slim black legs and
white pinafore disappearing across the hall, and
Jill could not help laughing. &#8216;I must catch
the post, and write to that child Jean,&#8217; she
decided, after a moment&#8217;s reflection. &#8216;It won&#8217;t
be so bad for the poor little mite if she has
some one to show her round.&#8217;</p>

<p>Late on the following afternoon the &#8216;adopted
kid&#8217; found another chance of making her way
to Barbara&#8217;s heart. Barbara had wandered into
the library, with a whole hour to spare before
the carriage should come round to drive her to
school; and, rather to her surprise, she discovered
Kit there, sitting huddled up in the
arm-chair, with his shoulders up to his ears.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
She had thought that all the boys were out
ratting, and she had not expected to see any of
them until they came in at tea-time to bid her
farewell. She was feeling rather doleful, now
that the important moment was so near, for she
realised that if she was going to everything that
was new and delightful, she was also going away
from the boys for the first time in her life. It
did not cheer her to find Christopher sitting
over the fire with an attack of asthma.</p>

<p>&#8216;Kit!&#8217; she cried in distress. &#8216;I didn&#8217;t know
you were ill!&#8217;</p>

<p>Kit crouched closer to the fire and growled.
Asthma always had a bad effect upon his temper,
and to-day he had a grievance as well.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course you didn&#8217;t know,&#8217; he muttered.
&#8216;You never know anything now. Can&#8217;t think
what&#8217;s come over you lately.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara reddened, and the tears welled up in
her eyes. No one could hurt her so easily as
Christopher. &#8216;I&#8217;m awfully sorry, Kit. I suppose
I&#8217;ve been thinking about school,&#8217; she said;
and she dropped the poker with a bang that
made him wince.</p>

<p>&#8216;Lucky for you to be able to go to school,&#8217;
answered Kit, crossly. &#8216;Look at me! Just
because of that journey on Wednesday I&#8217;ve got
to coddle like an old woman.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara stood gazing at him helplessly. Her
heart was full of pity, but no one had ever
taught her how to show it. &#8216;Poor old boy!&#8217;
she said awkwardly. &#8216;Would you like me to
tell you a story?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>&#8216;Not I! How can you think of a story
when you&#8217;re full of that stupid school?&#8217; was
the surly answer.</p>

<p>&#8216;But I&#8217;m not thinking about school now,
Kit,&#8217; persisted the Babe, becoming tearful.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, never mind. Don&#8217;t cry, whatever you
do; I&#8217;ve got such a headache,&#8217; said Christopher,
hastily.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m n&#8211;not crying; I never cry,&#8217; stammered
Barbara, in a shaky voice. &#8216;I&#8211;I want to do
something for you, only you won&#8217;t tell me what
to do.&#8217;</p>

<p>Kit answered her with a violent struggle for
breath, and the child felt more helpless than
ever. It was just as she was making a feeble
attempt to raise him in his chair that Jill came
in.</p>

<p>&#8216;You poor fellow!&#8217; she exclaimed, taking in
the whole scene at once. &#8216;Here, Babs, give
me that piece of brown paper, and run and
fetch his medicine, will you? Poor boy! Poor
Kit!&#8217;</p>

<p>She knelt beside him and supported him
with her arm, while she wafted a smouldering
tuft of brown paper in front of him. &#8216;Now,
fetch some cushions out of the drawing-room,&#8217;
she commanded, when Barbara returned with
the medicine; and, delighted at being given
something to do, the child sped away on her
errand. When she came back with her arms
full of cushions, Jill had a delightful plan to
unfold.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ring the bell for the lamp, Babs,&#8217; she said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
in her soft voice, which was already soothing
Christopher&#8217;s nerves; &#8216;and we&#8217;ll have tea together
before you go. Shall we, Kit, dear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s awfully good of you,&#8217; he answered
weakly. The attack was passing off, and he
was visibly cheering up. By the time tea was
brought in, he was sufficiently recovered to
take the lead in his usual determined manner;
and Jill humoured him by giving in to him
meekly, even consenting, under his guidance,
to toast slices of plum-cake at the end of a penknife.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s very extravagant, when it&#8217;s Auntie
Anna&#8217;s plum-cake instead of the stale stuff
cook used to make; but as it&#8217;s the Babe&#8217;s last
evening we may be extravagant, mayn&#8217;t we,
Jill?&#8217; argued Christopher. &#8216;Now, Babs, you
melt the butter; and for goodness&#8217; sake do
remember you&#8217;re not at home, and don&#8217;t smash
the plate.&#8217;</p>

<p>His reminder did not wholly make the desired
effect upon Babs, for when the boys returned
from the farm in a noisy tribe, flushed
with the glory of slaying, they found the
&#8216;adopted kid&#8217; scrubbing her gown with a clean
handkerchief, while Babs hung over her, covered
with confusion.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t worry yourself, child,&#8217; Jill was saying
consolingly. &#8216;A lump of butter, more or less,
doesn&#8217;t make any difference to a frock I&#8217;ve
worn all the winter.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It just slid off the plate when I wasn&#8217;t
looking,&#8217; said Barbara, penitently. &#8216;I can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
think why it didn&#8217;t slide on to my frock instead
of yours.&#8217;</p>

<p>A chorus of merriment rang from behind.</p>

<p>&#8216;You ridiculous Babe!&#8217; shouted Peter. &#8216;Why,
the butter is <i>tired</i> of being spilled down your
frock.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jill jumped to her feet, and blushed a little.
As Kit had predicted, she found it much easier
to get on with her cousins when she took them
&#8216;separately, or in pairs&#8217;; and she was not used
yet to facing them all at once. The sound of
wheels outside gave her an excuse for escape,
and she put her arm hurriedly round Babs.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come upstairs and put on your hat,&#8217; she suggested,
and the two girls hastened out of the
room.</p>

<p>Auntie Anna saw to it that the farewells
were not prolonged, and Barbara found herself
whirled into the covered wagonette with her
last words only half said. Kit was allowed time
to whisper a gruff apology for being cross with
her before tea, but the others had to follow her
to the front door to shout their good-byes after
her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t get the blues because <i>we</i> are not
there!&#8217; cried Wilfred.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll write great lots of times,&#8217; declared Robin,
who was in tears. &#8216;I won&#8217;t even wait for the
lines to be ruled, Babs dear. You won&#8217;t mind
the spelling, will you? &#8217;Cause it saves so much
time if you don&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Cheer up!&#8217; was all Egbert said; and Barbara
wondered if she was very hard-hearted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
because she was not half so wretched as they all
expected her to be. Peter even made her laugh
outright, as he sprang on the step of the carriage,
and went a little way down the drive
with them.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t funk it, old girl!&#8217; he shouted through
the window. &#8216;And just send for us, if anything
goes wrong!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Be off with you!&#8217; said Auntie Anna, shutting
up the window; and that was the last that
the Babe of the Berkeley family saw of the boys
who had been her only companions through
life.</p>

<p>She had plenty to think about in her long
drive in the dark; and Auntie Anna was wise
enough to leave her alone most of the time.
A little more than an hour later, however,
when the carriage made a sharp turn and drove
through some gates, the old lady roused her by
a touch on the arm.</p>

<p>&#8216;We are just there, little woman,&#8217; she said
in her quick, abrupt way. &#8216;Not afraid, eh?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh no!&#8217; answered Barbara, smiling. &#8216;I&#8211;I&#8217;m
just excited.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mrs. Crofton kissed the eager little face, on
which the light shone as they approached the
house.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s right,&#8217; she said, looking pleased.
&#8216;Always be a truthful little girl, and don&#8217;t mind
if you find you are not like other people.&#8217;</p>

<p>Then the horses stopped, and a blaze of light
shone down a flight of steps to the carriage
door; and Babs, feeling suddenly very small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
and unimportant, in spite of the extra inch or
two on her new serge frock, followed the old
lady into the great wide hall of Wootton
Beeches.</p>

<p>Her dream was coming true at last.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>HOW IT CAME TRUE</span></h2>

<p>Half an hour later, Barbara was being led
across the hall by Miss Finlayson, to be introduced
to her school-fellows in the playroom.
It puzzled her a little to see how calm and unconcerned
the head-mistress was looking. Did
she not know what a thrilling moment this was
to her little new pupil, who tripped along by
her side? As Babs was puzzling over it, they
reached the baize door on the opposite side of
the hall, and Miss Finlayson stooped and
fastened it back, disclosing a long passage
beyond. At the end of the passage was another
door; and through this other door the
murmur and hum of many voices drifted to the
ears of the excited child. She could hardly
contain her impatience; and she wondered
why Miss Finlayson did not go on, instead of
being so particular about the fastening of the
baize door. She even took a step forward in
her eagerness; but a hand was suddenly placed
on her shoulder, and Barbara glanced up and
met the half-amused gaze of the lady who had
just seemed so indifferent to her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>Miss Finlayson had a way of looking at a
girl that generally made a friend of her at once.
Her eyes were a peculiar shade of blue-grey
that gave them, as a rule, a cold expression;
but they were also capable of a glimpse of
humour that completely altered and softened
them, and it was the discovery of this quality in
them that changed Barbara&#8217;s impatience all at
once to curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8216;One moment, little girl, before you go
through that door over there,&#8217; began Miss
Finlayson, and her face was still grave in spite
of the betraying twinkle in her eyes. &#8216;Tell
me, have you ever known any girls before?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Only Jill,&#8217; answered Barbara, wondering
why she was being asked such an odd question.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; said Miss Finlayson. The child
caught the change in her tone, and went on
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8216;I know Jill didn&#8217;t approve of me at first,&#8217;
she said, in her small, anxious voice; &#8216;but she
does now, I think. Besides, Jill is grown-up,
you see; and I don&#8217;t think it counts if you are
grown-up, does it? I&#8217;ve never met any real,
nice, friendly girls before, who don&#8217;t tease you,
or bully you, or anything like that. That&#8217;s
why I wanted to come to school.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; said Miss Finlayson again. Then
she put out her hand and patted the cheek of
her little new pupil. &#8216;Do not be unhappy if
you find you are not like the other girls,&#8217; she
said, just as Auntie Anna had done; &#8216;and
come to me, if everything else fails and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
cannot stand by yourself. Only, remember&#8211;you
are not in the nursery any longer: you
have come here to learn how to grow up straight
and strong and healthy, just as a plant learns;
and I am only the gardener to give you a prop,
when you have been in too great a hurry and
are trying to grow too fast. Do you think you
understand?&#8217; Her voice changed again, and
a laugh came into it as she added brightly:
&#8216;Come along now, and be a happy little girl.
You will find that most of us are happy in this
house.&#8217;</p>

<p>She took Babs by the hand, and raced her
along the passage to the door at the end, then
turned the handle and pushed the child gently
into the room.</p>

<p>&#8216;Girls,&#8217; said the head-mistress, in the sudden
lull that followed her entrance, &#8216;here is a new
schoolfellow for you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Then all the voices broke out again, and
Miss Finlayson nodded to Barbara, and went
away. It was one of Miss Finlayson&#8217;s theories,
that a new girl should be left to fight her way
by herself; but as she retreated slowly along
the passage this evening, she could not help
feeling a little anxious about the child with the
small, eager face, whom she had just launched
into a strange and unfriendly world.</p>

<p>Barbara took two quick steps forward, as the
door closed behind her, and stood there waiting.
She had acted this scene over and over
again in her mind, and she had always made
her entrance like this; after which a girl, whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
face was plump and ordinary, and whose legs
were of the right proportions, and whose hair
was smooth and under proper control, had
always come towards her with a welcoming
smile and had led her up to the other girls,
who all had welcoming smiles too. And everybody
had listened to her while she talked about
her home and her father and the boys; and
nobody had laughed and nobody had teased,
and nobody had told her to &#8216;shut up.&#8217; It had
been a very favourite scene in her dream of
school, and she waited eagerly for the other
actors in it to come forward and do their part.
But no one moved.</p>

<p>The room in which she found herself was
certainly not like the one she had imagined.
It was long and low and prettily shaped, with
two wide bow-windows thrown out on one side
of it, and a great square fireplace taking up
most of the wall that faced the doorway. Next
to the fireplace was a curtained archway, which
evidently formed the entrance into another room,
judging by the buzz of laughter and conversation
from beyond that the thick red curtain failed
to stifle. The bookshelves on the two remaining
walls were made of plain oak; so were the
desks and chairs that stood neatly arranged
round the room in rows. There were also plain
oak benches in the warm chimney-corners, and
plain oak window-seats in the bowed recesses,
while the floor was made of the same wood and
was left quite bare, except for a rug in front of
the hearth. A pot or two of chrysanthemums,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
some blue china on the over-mantel, and one or
two hammered metal lamps that hung from the
beams in the ceiling, were the only ornaments
in the room; and the whole effect was so simple
and so clean that Barbara, fresh from the dingy
old schoolroom in which she had passed her
life until now, was obliged to forget everything
else for the moment and just stare round her.
Then her eyes rested again on the girls who were
scattered in groups about the room, and the expectant
look on her face became a little wistful.</p>

<p>There seemed to be thirty or forty of them
all together; and from the noise on the other
side of the curtain Babs concluded that there
were as many, or more, in the room beyond.
They all talked without ceasing,&#8211;all at once,
it seemed to Barbara,&#8211;about their Christmas
holidays and their Christmas presents, about the
parties they had been to and the pantomimes
they had seen, about the girls who were not
back and the girls who were, about everything,
in fact, except the child by the door, who
had been waiting all her life for this moment.
What did it matter to them that she should
go through a few seconds of embarrassment?
They had all been through the same, in their
time; and it was not to be supposed that they
should make things any easier for future generations
of new girls. So they went on babbling
about their own affairs, and Barbara went on
expecting some one to come and put an end to
her discomfort. But nobody came.</p>

<p>Slowly, she began to feel conscious, just as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
she had done when she first met Jill, that there
was something odd about her appearance. In
spite of the extra inch or two on the bottom
hem of her frock, and the temporary smoothness
that a vigorous application of a wet brush had
produced on her hair, Babs saw with a kind of
dismay that she was not made in the same
pattern as the crowd of neatly dressed girls
before her. None of them wore her hair loose
and curly like her own, and none of them
looked as though she did not know what to do
with her hands. If only she could have held
on to something, Barbara felt sure she would
not have felt so shy or so helpless. There was
a chair only two yards off; but something kept
her standing where she was, and she did not
even reach out her hand to it.</p>

<p>The girls continued their conversation, and
forgot all about the new-comer that Miss Finlayson
had brought in. Most of them stood facing
the fire and had not even looked at her; and the
others, who glanced now and then towards
the door, only shrugged their shoulders and
wondered why the stupid child did not sit down,
instead of standing still in that purposeless
manner. They did not mean to be unkind,
but how were they to know that she was fighting
through her first disillusionment?</p>

<p>All at once, a diversion was made by two
children from the other room, who came tumbling
through the curtain and nearly upset a tall
fair girl who was the centre of the group round
the fire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>&#8216;Look where you are going, Angela
Wilkins!&#8217; said the fair girl, sternly. &#8216;What
are you children doing in here, I should like
to know?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Please, Margaret, don&#8217;t be cross, and <i>do</i> let
me explain,&#8217; begged Angela Wilkins, suppressing
an inclination to giggle, and pouring out
her words hastily. &#8216;Jean has had millions of
letters from Jill Urquhart, and she says<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It wasn&#8217;t millions, Angela, it was only one,&#8217;
corrected her fellow-culprit from behind.</p>

<p>&#8216;And what business has Jean Murray to
hear from Jill Urquhart?&#8217; demanded the fair
girl.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t want to hear from her,&#8217;
grumbled the other girl, whom Angela pushed
forward to answer for herself. &#8216;She only writes
to me when she wants something. I don&#8217;t call
that <i>writing</i> to a person.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s got a sister coming here this term,
and she says everybody has got to look after
her, or something like that,&#8217; chimed in the
irrepressible Angela.</p>

<p>&#8216;It isn&#8217;t a sister, it&#8217;s a cousin. And she
hasn&#8217;t asked everybody; I wish she had. She&#8217;s
asked <i>me</i> to look after her, and that&#8217;s a very
different thing,&#8217; complained Jean Murray, looking
distinctly aggrieved.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; added Angela, breathlessly; &#8216;why
should Jean be bothered with all the new
girls who happen to be people&#8217;s cousins?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She isn&#8217;t,&#8217; said Margaret, curtly. &#8216;It&#8217;s only
one new girl; and if she is a cousin of Jill&#8217;s,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
Jean ought to be very proud of being asked
to look after her. Do stop exaggerating,
Angela; and go away, both of you!&#8217; Then
just as the children slunk off subdued, she
recalled them and made a gesture towards
the door. &#8216;There&#8217;s a new girl over there
now, I believe,&#8217; she continued indifferently.
&#8216;You&#8217;d better see whether she&#8217;s the right
one; and if she is, bring her to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>She turned again to the fireplace, and the
two girls made their way towards the other
end of the room, where Barbara still stood
unnoticed. She saw them coming, and heaved
a sigh of relief. Things were a long while
happening in this school; but it was something
if they happened in the end. She glanced at
their two faces as they came nearer, and felt
disappointed when the one with the cross
expression addressed her first.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, what&#8217;s your name?&#8217; began Jean,
ungraciously.</p>

<p>&#8216;Barbara,&#8217; answered the child, faintly. Her
dream seemed more improbable than ever, in
the presence of this small stranger with the
aggressive manner.</p>

<p>&#8216;Barbara what?&#8217; asked Jean, impatiently.</p>

<p>Babs stared, and added her surname unwillingly.
At home, when people spoke like that,
they had to do without an answer.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s the one,&#8217; grumbled Jean to her companion.
Then she addressed Barbara again.
&#8216;How old are you?&#8217; she asked, in the same
abrupt way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>&#8216;Eleven,&#8217; answered Babs, obediently. &#8216;How
old are you?&#8217;</p>

<p>It was Jean&#8217;s turn to stare. &#8216;What business
is it of yours?&#8217; she exclaimed. After a moment&#8217;s
consideration, however, she found a satisfactory
reason for replying. &#8216;I&#8217;m a year older than you,
anyhow,&#8217; she added triumphantly, &#8216;so you&#8217;ll be
the youngest in the school now, and you can
take off the head girl&#8217;s boots.&#8217;</p>

<p>Before Barbara had time to realise this
penalty, or privilege, belonging to her youth,
Angela Wilkins, who had been silent for quite
a surprising length of time, suddenly attacked
her afresh. &#8216;Are you really Jill&#8217;s cousin?&#8217; she
asked, with a giggle.</p>

<p>Babs nodded; but Angela did not seem
convinced. &#8216;You&#8217;re not a bit like her, are
you? Jill Urquhart is so pretty and graceful
and all that,&#8217; she observed with engaging frankness,
and then giggled again.</p>

<p>Barbara said nothing; it was certainly unnecessary
to agree with such a very obvious
statement. Jean Murray, who had also been
examining her closely in her turn, evidently
seemed to think a further snubbing was required
of her.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re frightfully tall for your age,&#8217; she
remarked disapprovingly, as though Barbara
were somehow to be held responsible for her
height. &#8216;If I had straight spiky legs like
yours, I should have my dresses made longer.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, you wouldn&#8217;t, if you had five brothers
always wanting you to do things,&#8217; retorted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
Barbara, promptly. It was saddening to find
that, even here, people were prepared to make
remarks about the slimness of her legs.</p>

<p>Angela was so surprised at her sudden show
of resistance that she forgot to giggle.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, you&#8217;d better not speak like that to
Jean Murray,&#8217; she said in a warning tone,
glancing as she spoke at Jean, as though she
expected her to take immediate measures for
the suppression of the new girl. &#8216;She&#8217;s been
the youngest for so long that naturally she&#8217;s
inclined to be jealous, now you&#8217;ve come to
take her place. Of course she has to pretend
she&#8217;s glad, but you can&#8217;t expect her to like
the idea of somebody else taking off the head
girl&#8217;s<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, if that&#8217;s all,&#8217; said Barbara, indifferently,
&#8216;I don&#8217;t want to take off anybody&#8217;s boots,
thank you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll have to, whether you like it or not,&#8217;
interposed Jean, who had been listening quite
complacently to Angela&#8217;s description of her
feelings. &#8216;Come along now, and see Margaret
Hulme; and don&#8217;t be such a month about it,
or else we shall catch it for stopping in here so
long.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who is Margaret Hulme, and why have I
got to go and see her?&#8217; asked Babs, hanging
back a little. It was so perplexing to have
to do things without being given any reason
for it.</p>

<p>Both the girls opened their eyes wide.
&#8216;Why, she is the head girl!&#8217; they explained,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
as if that were reason enough for anything;
and without waiting for any more objections,
they pulled her across the room to where the
fair girl still made the centre of the group
round the fire. She kept them waiting for
some seconds before she condescended to
notice that they were there.</p>

<p>&#8216;Didn&#8217;t I tell you to go back to your own
playroom?&#8217; she demanded presently. Then
her eyes fell on Barbara, and she scanned
her critically up and down.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is Jill Urquhart&#8217;s cousin,&#8217; explained
Jean, hurriedly, and she gave Barbara an unexpected
push that sent her stumbling, with her
usual lack of good fortune, right against the
head girl.</p>

<p>&#8216;Take care, child!&#8217; said Margaret, frowning.
And while Babs stammered out some apology,
she turned to the other girls behind her and
said something that made them all laugh.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s only eleven, though she&#8217;s so awfully
tall; and her name is Barbara Berkeley,&#8217; volunteered
Angela, peering over the shoulder of the
new girl.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who spoke to you?&#8217; inquired the head girl,
sarcastically, looking back again. She once
more scanned Barbara all over, and smiled in
an annoying manner to herself. &#8216;However did
Jill manage to have a cousin like you?&#8217; she
asked; and the other girls laughed more than
before.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; said Barbara, with a touch of
scorn in her voice. The mysterious way in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
which the head girl and her admirers were
laughing at her was very different from the
frank teasing she was accustomed to; and it
gave her a sudden wish to assert herself. &#8216;I
never pretended to be like Jill, or like any of
you! I&#8211;I don&#8217;t think I want to be like you,
either. In my home, we don&#8217;t laugh behind
people&#8217;s backs.&#8217;</p>

<p>She caused quite a small sensation in the
group round the fire. One or two began to
titter afresh, and then stopped, waiting for the
head girl to take the lead. The head girl was
equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is very certain, then, that you have stayed
in your own home quite long enough,&#8217; she remarked
coldly, and resumed her conversation
with her friends.</p>

<p>The two children dragged Barbara through
the curtain into the next room.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, you <i>have</i> got some cheek!&#8217; gasped
Jean Murray, staring at her. &#8216;Lucky for you
that you&#8217;re a new girl! If it had been <i>me</i>,
Margaret Hulme wouldn&#8217;t have spoken to me
for a whole day.&#8217;</p>

<p>The enormity of such a punishment did not
for the moment impress Barbara much. What
she did notice was that her passage of words
with the head girl had broken the ice of her
introduction to the junior playroom, especially
with the aid of Angela&#8217;s highly coloured account
of it.</p>

<p>&#8216;You never saw such a thing!&#8217; she was exclaiming
rapidly to the circle that formed round
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
her. &#8216;There was Margaret, looking like a
dozen thunder-clouds rolled into one, and there
was the new girl, grinning from ear to ear, not
caring a bit what anybody thought of her and
just standing up to the head girl as if she was
in the First herself.&#8217;</p>

<p>The new girl barely recognised this description
of herself; but as it made her an object
of curiosity, if not of sympathy, in the junior
playroom, she did not feel inclined to correct
the picture that the red-haired, freckled little
chatterbox was painting of her. Anything was
better than being left out in the cold again. It
struck her too that the girls in the junior room
were far less inclined to laugh at her than
the elder ones had seemed; and it raised her
fallen spirits a little to find that the children
who were now strolling up to her, with inquisitive
glances at her hair, her clothes, and everything
else about her, seemed disposed, in spite
of their calm curiosity, to show her a kind of
rough friendliness. They were more like boys,
these smaller people in the junior playroom;
and Barbara, though still failing to realise
her child&#8217;s ideal of girls, felt a faint kinship
with their straightforward method of addressing
her.</p>

<p>&#8216;No nickname?&#8217; they asked, when she had
again admitted her name and her age.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, yes,&#8217; answered Barbara, unsuspiciously,
&#8216;the boys always call me the Babe, or<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>The peals of laughter that interrupted her
puzzled her a good deal. It was very queer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
that, wherever she went, people always laughed
at her. It was some moments before their glee
over the nickname, that so exactly suited the
childish impression she produced, began to
subside.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you got a nurse?&#8217; asked Angela, who
had laughed louder than any one.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said Barbara, simply, not seeing that
this too was meant to be a joke. &#8216;She left,
two years ago.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, you ought to have one,&#8217; retorted Jean,
brusquely. &#8216;She might teach you how to comb
your hair.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And let down your frock,&#8217; added two or
three voices together.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter with my frock?&#8217; asked
Babs, opening her eyes. &#8216;It&#8217;s nearly two inches
longer than any frock I ever had before.&#8217;</p>

<p>The laughter began afresh, and Barbara gave
up trying to explain things. She was a little
hurt, in reality, and was afraid of showing it;
for it would never do, after being teased by
five brothers all her life, to be ruffled by the
laughter of a few schoolgirls. All the same,
there was something in their way of laughing
at her that hurt, and she did not care to provoke
them into doing it any more.</p>

<p>The loud ringing of a bell brought her a
sudden respite, by clearing the room of her
tormentors. They poured hastily out of two
large doors, that slid back in the wall and
revealed another square hall beyond, similar to
the one at the front of the house. The wide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
staircase up which the girls were trooping evidently
led to their bedrooms, for Barbara, left
deserted and forgotten in the playroom, could
hear them, directly afterwards, moving about
overhead. As she waited there alone, wondering
what she was supposed to do next, Jean
Murray came hurrying back into the room and
looked round for her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, bother!&#8217; she said, in her ungracious
manner; &#8216;what a nuisance you are! I wish
you&#8217;d do things without waiting to be told.&#8217;</p>

<p>Babs explained submissively that she was
quite ready to do things if she only knew what
to do; but Jean still grumbled.</p>

<p>&#8216;Any one with any sense would know,&#8217; she
declared, hastening out of the door again as
she spoke. When she was half-way across the
hall, she shouted, without looking back, &#8216;Can&#8217;t
you come along? There&#8217;s only a quarter of an
hour to dress for supper.&#8217;</p>

<p>Babs hurried after her, and managed to keep
her in sight up the wide staircase and along the
gallery at the top. There were doors all round
the gallery, and at one of these, marked number
twelve, Jean stopped and waited impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8216;What a time you are,&#8217; she complained, when
Barbara caught her up.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m very quick, when anybody doesn&#8217;t take
such an enormous start,&#8217; answered Barbara,
panting. &#8216;I can beat Peter twice round the
Square and up to the gate, <i>easily</i>! And you&#8217;re
not in it with Peter.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean looked at her, and her expression was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
not a pretty one. However, she only jerked
her head at the door in front of them, and told
Babs it was her bedroom. &#8216;Finny said I was
to show you,&#8217; she added. &#8216;Don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m
sure, why everybody thinks I&#8217;ve got to show
you things. And you&#8217;d better look sharp and
dress, because when you&#8217;re ready you&#8217;ve got to
cut along to number two and do the head girl&#8217;s
hair. It&#8217;s always the business of the youngest
in the school to do the head girl&#8217;s hair. See?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But I don&#8217;t know how to do anybody&#8217;s hair,&#8217;
began Barbara, in a fever of dismay. But Jean
had already scampered out of hearing; and
with her responsibilities weighing heavily upon
her, the new girl turned the handle of her bedroom
door and went forlornly in. It was a
simple little room, very clean and fresh-looking,
with everything there that she wanted and
nothing that she could do without. The pretty
coverlets on the bed and the dressing-table
and the muslin curtains that draped the oaken
window-sash gave it a look of homely comfort,
while harmonising with the plain green colour
of the walls and the blue frieze and carpet.
As Barbara walked across her small domain
and pushed aside the blind to peep out into
the clear starlit night, a moment&#8217;s rest came to
her perturbed little mind. The tiny bare room
was all hers, and the feeling of privacy and
possession was very comforting.</p>

<p>A door in the wall told her there was a room
leading out of hers, and the sound made by
some one moving rapidly about in it reminded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
her again of her present woes and of the
necessity for dressing as quickly as possible.
Her relief at not being obliged to sleep with
the other girls was forgotten in her returning
consciousness of having to live with them, and
to do their hair and to button their boots.
With desperate haste she struggled out of her
serge frock and into a muslin one, that had a
strange new method of fastening that was
extremely baffling; and five minutes later,
trembling, uneasy, and flushed with the hurry
of her speedy toilet, she stood knocking at the
door of number two.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s me,&#8217; she said feebly, in response to the
curt inquiry from within. Her inadequate
explanation was followed by a few quick steps
on the other side of the door, which was then
flung open with an impatient movement; and
the head girl, putting hairpins rapidly into her
hair as she stood, was looking down at her
sternly.</p>

<p>&#8216;You should go to one of the younger ones,
if you want to know anything,&#8217; she said crossly.
&#8216;Where&#8217;s Jean Murray?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It was Jean Murray who told me to come,&#8217;
answered the child, looking a pathetic little
object in her half-fastened muslin frock, with
her hair standing out wildly round her head.
&#8216;I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t want to come; I don&#8217;t
know how to do anybody&#8217;s hair; I told her
so. But she said it was because I was the
youngest, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What <i>are</i> you talking about, child?&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
interrupted Margaret. Her mystified look was lost
on Babs, however, as the child stared down in
much misery and confusion at the little steel
buckles on her new evening shoes. She went
on unhappily with her stammering confession.</p>

<p>&#8216;She said I&#8217;d got to do the head girl&#8217;s hair
because I was the youngest, and I was to make
haste, or I shouldn&#8217;t be in time. I did make as
much haste as I could, <i>truthfully</i>,&#8217; she added,
looking up timidly at her frowning questioner;
&#8216;but there were such a lot of hooks on my new
frock, and I&#8217;m not used to hooks. I&#8217;ve always
had buttons before, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>One or two of the neighbouring doors had
opened by this time, and quite a small audience
was assembling to hear Barbara&#8217;s attempt at
explanation. A giggle that swelled into a
laugh brought dismay once more into her heart;
and a suspicion that she had been hoaxed slowly
dawned upon her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Isn&#8217;t it true?&#8217; she cried, turning upon them
desperately. &#8216;Haven&#8217;t I got to do the head
girl&#8217;s hair?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;d better do your own first, I should
say,&#8217; observed one of the onlookers, carelessly;
and the others laughed again.</p>

<p>The head girl silenced them peremptorily.
&#8216;Don&#8217;t, Ruth!&#8217; she said. &#8216;It&#8217;s only a babe,
after all. You others had better go downstairs;
the supper-bell will ring directly.&#8217;</p>

<p>The gallery slowly emptied itself, except for
the little group of three that still stood outside
the head girl&#8217;s door. The offending Ruth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
turned to Barbara; she had a good-natured
face, and was looking penitent.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come here, child, and let me fasten your
frock properly,&#8217; she said; &#8216;you&#8217;ve done it up all
wrong.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara turned her back to her willingly.
&#8216;It&#8217;s awfully bricky of you,&#8217; she said warmly;
&#8216;I&#8217;ve never done up my own frock before, and
this one was so complicated, somehow.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You must come to me when you want your
frocks fastened,&#8217; answered her new friend. &#8216;I
sleep next door to you, and I always help
Angela, whose room is on the farther side of
mine. You&#8217;ve only got to tap at the door
between, when you are ready. But you mustn&#8217;t
speak in the morning before breakfast, or in the
evening after prayers, because that is against
the rules.&#8217;</p>

<p>She fetched a brush and tried to reduce the
tangled hair under her hands to a certain
degree of order. Margaret Hulme had disposed
of all her hairpins by this time, and was
closely watching a door on the other side of
the gallery. When it at last opened she
straightened herself and prepared for action.</p>

<p>It was Jean Murray who came out of it,
rather cautiously at first, then with a pretence of
great unconcern. But her jaunty air completely
deserted her when she saw the little group
outside the head girl&#8217;s door, and she tried to
slink away towards the stairs unnoticed. Margaret
called her back authoritatively, and Jean
came slowly and unwillingly round the gallery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>&#8216;Now,&#8217; said the head girl, when she was
within easy hearing, &#8216;just you apologise to
Barbara Berkeley for hoaxing her just now.
If you think there is anything funny in telling
an untruth, I&#8217;m sorry for your sense of humour,
and you&#8217;d better not do it again in this house.
Now then, make haste about it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara tried impetuously to interfere, but
Ruth Oliver held her back. &#8216;Hush!&#8217; she
whispered. &#8216;Leave it to Margaret.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean was shifting from one foot to another,
and her mouth began to quiver. &#8216;I didn&#8217;t
know she&#8217;d be such a stupid as to believe it,&#8217;
she muttered.</p>

<p>&#8216;My dear child,&#8217; said the head girl, blandly,
&#8216;nobody supposed you were any judge of character.
So it would clearly be wiser not to play
that kind of joke on any one in future, wouldn&#8217;t
it? Are you going to apologise or not?&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean reddened, and a lump rose in her
throat. Her worship of the head girl was the
most genuine thing about her, and she was
suffering keenly under her disapproval. But
an apology to a new girl, especially to one who
had come to rob her of all her privileges, was
next to an impossibility. Barbara saved the
situation.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t want anybody&#8217;s apologies,&#8217; she
cried. &#8216;I&#8217;m not cross, and I don&#8217;t know what
you&#8217;re all talking about.&#8217; She wriggled away
from the friendly grasp of Ruth Oliver, and
sped round the gallery till she came to the
head of the stairs. Arrived there, the temptation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
of a long, broad, shining baluster-rail was
too much for her; and in another moment the
little elf-like figure in the fresh muslin frock
was astride of it and flying down to the hall,
with her hair once more in rebellion round her
face. The exhilaration of the brief rush downwards
sent all her troubles out of her head, and
she uttered a war-whoop of delight as she
landed with a thump on the mat at the bottom.
The elder girls, who were just streaming across
the hall in response to the supper-bell, stopped
and stared aghast. Certainly the new girl was
the most impudent of her species, and meant to
make her entry into the establishment of
Wootton Beeches with a flourish! But Margaret
Hulme, it was rumoured, had taken her
up; and that meant that the elder girls were
no longer in a position to criticise her.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE INK BOGIES</span></h2>

<p>Barbara&#8217;s disappointment had lost some of its
bitterness by the time the seven o&#8217;clock bell
woke her on the following morning. Perhaps,
after all, it was her own fault that things had
not turned out so delightfully as she had expected.
Even the boys used to call her clumsy
and stupid sometimes; so why should she
expect any more tolerance from her school-fellows?
Anyhow, here was the beginning of
another day, and there was still plenty of time
for her dream to come true.</p>

<p>It did not seem much like coming true,
though, as she stood in the juniors&#8217; room after
breakfast, jostled from right to left by the girls
who were on their way to the different classrooms,
and wondering when somebody would
come and tell her where she was to go. She
wished rather sadly that everybody in this
school would not expect her to know things by
instinct.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do <i>you</i> know where I am to go?&#8217; she
begged, catching hold of Jean Murray as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
hurried by. Babs had forgotten, if, indeed, she
had ever realised, that Jean looked upon her
as an enemy.</p>

<p>&#8216;Go and ask one of the seniors,&#8217; retorted
Jean, shaking her off. &#8216;You&#8217;re much too high
and mighty to have anything to do with us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is she talking about?&#8217; asked the
amazed Barbara, looking after her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, it isn&#8217;t likely she can forget all at once
that you got her a scolding from Margaret
Hulme,&#8217; explained Angela, who was hurrying
as usual after her friend, like a shadow.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>I</i> got her a scolding? What do you mean?&#8217;
cried Babs.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s all very well to be so innocent,&#8217;
snorted Angela; and she disappeared too.</p>

<p>Barbara sighed and remained where she was,
till she was moved on again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do get out of the way,&#8217; complained some
one else; &#8216;you&#8217;re right in front of my bookshelf.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara sprang aside hastily, and caught her
foot in the leg of a desk and fell down.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t mind moving,&#8217; she said, getting up
again and rubbing her elbow, &#8216;but I do wish I
knew where to move to.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can&#8217;t you find out?&#8217; asked the owner of the
bookshelf inconsistently, as she rushed off with
her arms full of books.</p>

<p>Barbara sighed again. Try as she might to
make the best of things, it was a little tiring to
be such a universal object of complaint.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hullo, Babe! You ought not to be here,&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
said a cheery voice from the seniors&#8217; room, and
Ruth Oliver put her head round the red curtain.
&#8216;This is only the playroom, you know, and,
except for preparation or for fetching your
books between the classes, you are never supposed
to use it in lesson-time. The classrooms
are upstairs.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I know I oughtn&#8217;t to be here,&#8217; answered Babs,
ruefully. &#8216;I never am where I ought to be.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But Finny sent for you, ages ago,&#8217; said
Ruth, looking astonished. &#8216;Didn&#8217;t Jean tell
you? She&#8217;s a young horror, that Jean. Never
mind, come along with me, and I&#8217;ll show you
the way.&#8217;</p>

<p>She hurried the child through the baize
door into the front hall, and pointed out a room
that was close to the foot of the stairs. &#8216;That&#8217;s
Finny&#8217;s study,&#8217; she said hastily. &#8216;You&#8217;d better
look sharp. Good luck to you!&#8217; She gave
her an unexpected kiss that promptly secured
her the child&#8217;s allegiance from henceforth, and
ran off with her books under her arm.</p>

<p>Barbara entered the room, and looked round
for Miss Finlayson. Only the head girl was
there, however, sitting at the table with a frown
upon her face.</p>

<p>&#8216;You ought to have been here before this,&#8217;
she began reprovingly. &#8216;Miss Finlayson
couldn&#8217;t wait any longer, so I&#8217;ve got to miss
the history lecture and examine you, instead of
her. Why couldn&#8217;t you come, directly Jean
told you?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara turned a little red and tried to look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
unconcerned, in which she signally failed. &#8216;I
think,&#8217; she said, &#8216;that you&#8217;d better ask Jean.&#8217;</p>

<p>Margaret looked at her sharply, and muttered
something that sounded uncommonly like
&#8216;Little beast!&#8217; which seemed to the child rather
more than she deserved, considering that it was
really Jean&#8217;s fault and not hers at all. She
was rather surprised at the head girl&#8217;s next
words, which seemed quite gentle by comparison.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, you look blue with cold, child,&#8217; she
remarked, and drew her round by the fire.
&#8216;Now, stand there, and tell me what history
books you have been using.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I haven&#8217;t used any,&#8217; answered Babs. &#8216;I
haven&#8217;t had any history lessons, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you mean to say you know nothing
about the history of England&#8211;nothing about
wars or kings or laws, or any of those things?&#8217;
inquired Margaret, raising her eyebrows.</p>

<p>Barbara&#8217;s face brightened. &#8216;Oh, yes,&#8217; she
said, &#8216;I know all about <i>them</i> from father, and
the British Museum, and books. I didn&#8217;t know
that was history.&#8217;</p>

<p>Margaret was a little puzzled. The examination
of this new girl looked as though it were
going to present difficulties. &#8216;What kind of
books?&#8217; she asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8216;Lots of kinds,&#8217; answered Barbara, glibly.
&#8216;Napier&#8217;s <i>History of the Peninsular War</i>, and
somebody else&#8217;s <i>History of the Anglo-Saxons</i>,
and another one called <i>The Four Georges</i>, and&#8211;and&#8211;oh,
that long stuffy one, cut up into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
volumes, with ever so many funny words in it,
called <i>Cromwell&#8217;s Life and</i><span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s enough,&#8217; cried Margaret, and she
looked in amazement at the small animated face
of the new girl. &#8216;I&#8211;I think that will do for
history,&#8217; she went on hastily. &#8216;Now, what
about geography? I suppose you know the
elements, so I won&#8217;t<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s elements?&#8217; interrupted Babs.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, the beginning part,&#8217; explained the
head girl&#8211;&#8216;the part that tells you the meaning
of islands and volcanoes and earthquakes, and
what the world is like inside, and things about
the moon and the<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But all <i>that</i> is in Jules Verne&#8217;s story-books,&#8217;
remarked Babs. &#8216;Of course I&#8217;ve read Jules
Verne. Is that what you call elements? I
like elements, then, especially the <i>Journey to
the Centre of</i><span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I say, do stop,&#8217; interrupted Margaret,
biting her lip. She was divided between perplexity
and amusement, and she wished that
the head-mistress had stayed to examine this
extraordinary imp of a child herself. &#8216;Haven&#8217;t
you used any real geography books?&#8217; she
asked presently.</p>

<p>Barbara looked vague.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you know the map of England, for instance?&#8217;
pursued Margaret, rather desperately.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, yes, I know the map of England,&#8217;
answered the child, confidently. &#8216;It&#8217;s so easy
to find, because it&#8217;s pink. I know America
too, because father has gone there to lecture,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
and he won&#8217;t be back for ever so long, not
till<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hush!&#8217; said the head girl. &#8216;Tell me what
arithmetic you have done.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Let me see, that&#8217;s figures without letters,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8217; inquired Babs. &#8216;I&#8217;m afraid I can
only add up, because Bobbin hasn&#8217;t got any
further yet; he&#8217;s backward in sums, you see,
and I&#8217;ve only learnt mine through helping him
with his prep. Sometimes, I wish he&#8217;d get on a
little faster, because I&#8217;m getting so tired of<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then you mean to say,&#8217; interposed Margaret,
rather impatiently, &#8216;that you can only do simple
addition?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s in arithmetic,&#8217; Barbara hastened to
point out. &#8216;I&#8217;ve got as far as fractions in the
funny sums that Kit does out of the other
book; they&#8217;re much easier, because they have
letters dotted about to help you. I always do
Kit&#8217;s sums, when he has asthma; but he says
I&#8217;m very slow. Then there&#8217;s the nice interesting
book with pictures of triangles and things;
we&#8217;ve got up to<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, don&#8217;t!&#8217; said Margaret, and Barbara
paused, a little surprised. Why did people ask
her questions if they did not mean her to
answer them? Margaret was drumming her
fingers on the table and looking a little worried.
&#8216;Have you learnt any languages?&#8217; she asked
suddenly. &#8216;I mean, anything besides French&#8211;German,
for instance?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, I haven&#8217;t learnt any German, and I don&#8217;t
want to, thank you,&#8217; said Babs, decidedly. &#8216;Ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
since the German band complained to father,
because Peter tried to stop their noise by shying
potatoes at them from the window, we&#8217;ve
all made a vow never to learn their beastly
language. And I don&#8217;t know any French
either; no more does father. I know Latin
up to the deponent verbs, though,&#8211;deponent
verbs <i>are</i> catchy, aren&#8217;t they?&#8211;and I&#8217;ve begun
Greek with father. I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s all the
languages I<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, you are a curiosity!&#8217; declared Margaret,
giving up the attempt to hide her amusement.
&#8216;So you&#8217;ve never had a governess at
all? Nor been to classes?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve been to a gymnastic class,&#8217; said
Barbara, eagerly. &#8216;It&#8217;s the only thing I can
do properly. Have you got a gymnasium
here?&#8217;</p>

<p>She clapped her hands when Margaret
nodded, and bounded towards the door.
&#8216;Mayn&#8217;t I go and try it <i>now</i>?&#8217; she asked in a
disappointed tone, when the head girl called
her back.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s plenty of time for that,&#8217; said Margaret,
reminding her with a frown that she
was only a new girl and was there to be
examined; &#8216;I&#8217;ve got to settle first what class
you had better go into. But I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t
know what I am to say to Finny about you.&#8217;
She sighed, and looked at Barbara as if for
inspiration. Barbara was quite equal to the
occasion.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;d better put me in the bottom class, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
should think,&#8217; she advised pleasantly; &#8216;you
don&#8217;t know what my spelling is like yet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Thanks,&#8217; said Margaret, drily; &#8216;I&#8217;ve no
doubt you are quite competent to examine
yourself, and to teach all your betters into the
bargain, but that doesn&#8217;t help me just now.&#8217;
She drummed her fingers on the table again,
and Barbara waited and went off into a kind of
dream as she stood there. She was aroused by
an exclamation from the head girl. &#8216;I know,&#8217;
she was saying in a relieved tone. &#8216;Can you
write compositions, child? I mean, make up
things in your head and write them down?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara smiled. Certainly, that had nothing
to do with lessons. She had scribbled over
every piece of paper she could find, ever since
Nurse had first taught her to form her letters.
&#8216;I can do that all right,&#8217; she said. &#8216;All except
the spelling,&#8217; she added as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Margaret paid her no attention. She was
occupied in carrying out her happy idea for concluding
the examination of the new girl and
leaving herself free at the same time to go to her
history lecture. &#8216;Look here,&#8217; she said, spreading
some paper rapidly on the desk in front of her;
&#8216;come and sit in this chair and write about anything
you like. You&#8217;ll have a good hour and a
half before the interval for lunch; and then Miss
Finlayson will come and look at what you&#8217;ve
written, and she will settle what class you can
go into.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But what shall I write about?&#8217; asked Barbara,
when the head girl had installed her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
at the table and was hurrying out of the
room.</p>

<p>&#8216;Anything you like; it will be all the better
test if I don&#8217;t give you a subject,&#8217; said Margaret;
and she escaped before the child had time to
say any more. She felt a little mean about it,
for she was positive she could not have done it
herself; but she consoled herself by the reflection
that the new girl was queer enough for
anything. Besides, she did not want to miss
the whole of her history class for the sake of
examining a child who was ignorant of all the
things that other children knew, but had picked
up the most extraordinary bits of knowledge by
herself. So Babs was left to face the difficulty,
for the first time in her life, of writing something
within a given time.</p>

<p>It was certainly not easy to think of anything
to say, in this unfamiliar, austere little room,
with a blank sheet of paper staring at her, and
some one preparing to pounce upon her presently,
to criticise what she had done. In the
library at home such a chance as this would
have filled her with joy, and the paper would
have been covered in a few minutes with a
medley about giants and princesses and dragons,
to be told later on to Kit and Bobbin when they
clamoured for a story. But here it seemed impossible
to get a single word on to her sheet of
paper, and she looked at the clock in despair, and
wondered what would happen to her when Miss
Finlayson returned and found she had written
nothing. She plunged her pen desperately into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
the ink at last, and wrote the first thing that
came into her head. It was a title she remembered
noticing on the back of a book with a
smart cover&#8211;one that had lately been added
to her father&#8217;s library. She did not know what
it meant, and she was not sure what she was
going to say about it, but it sounded more like
the kind of thing to choose for an examination
than one of her fairy stories would have been.
Then, just as she had written the heading very
crookedly across the top of the page, she found
that the pen she had picked up was a quill,
and possessed the most entrancing capacity for
making splutters. It was the first time she had
happened upon a quill, and the discovery was
too delightful to be neglected. So she spent
the next ten minutes in adorning her paper with
fantastic ink shapes, that she named bogies on
the spot and wove into a fairy story about an
enchanted princess, who had to write a composition
in an hour and a half. When this
exciting occupation began to pall, she was seized
with a sudden desire to explore, and began
wandering restlessly round the room. There
was very little to examine besides books; but
books were always good enough for Barbara,
and she became very quiet and absorbed as her
inky forefinger travelled slowly along the bottom
shelves, until she had exhausted the outsides of
all the volumes that came within her reach.
Then she stood back, with her hands behind
her, and stared up at the ones above her head;
and a familiar name, printed in dull gold letters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
on the back of a solid volume in russet brown,
suddenly made her heart leap.</p>

<p>&#8216;Father&#8217;s book!&#8217; she gasped. &#8216;There&#8217;s
father&#8217;s book! And I&#8217;ve been in this stupid
place all this time, and never discovered it till
now! Oh, I must get father&#8217;s book!&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a sob in her throat when she
found that even a footstool, placed on the
highest chair in the room, did not mount her
up sufficiently to reach the precious volume.
Her bright little eyes travelled quickly round
the study, to embrace all its resources, and she
very nearly uttered one of her wild war-whoops
of delight when she spied a step-ladder half
hidden in a dark corner. It did not take her
a minute to stagger with it across the room
and to fix it, more or less securely, against the
bookshelf. After that, there was no sound in
the little study except the ticking of the clock
and the rustling of leaves, until the door opened
sharply and the owner herself walked in.</p>

<p>For a moment Miss Finlayson thought the
room was empty. Then she saw the small
figure with the big book, perched on the top of
the ladder; and the quaintness of the picture
made her smile irresistibly. &#8216;What are you
doing, Barbara?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>She spoke as softly as she could, but the
sound of her voice was quite enough to startle
the unconscious child. She dropped the heavy
book with a thud, and would have lost her
balance and plunged after it, had not Miss
Finlayson been prepared for the contingency
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
and put out an arm to save her. Babs caught
at it wildly, and found herself lifted down and
placed on the floor in safety.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson had stopped smiling, but she
did not look very angry. &#8216;What were you
doing up there, Barbara?&#8217; she repeated gently.</p>

<p>&#8216;I was reading father&#8217;s book,&#8217; answered
Barbara, rubbing her eyes. &#8216;I didn&#8217;t know it
was there, till I looked up and saw it; and then
I just climbed up and got it. I think I must
have been reading a great long time, because
I&#8217;ve got such an ache just there.&#8217; She curled
her hand under her arm and thumped the
middle of her back. &#8216;Do you ever get an ache
in the middle of your back when you&#8217;ve been
reading?&#8217; she inquired earnestly.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson did not answer immediately.
She stooped and picked up the fallen book first,
and replaced it on the shelf. Barbara began to
wonder if she was angry, and if that was why
she had such an odd, serious look on her face.</p>

<p>&#8216;And do you like your father&#8217;s book, Barbara?&#8217;
she asked presently.</p>

<p>&#8216;I think it&#8217;s the most beautiful book in all
the world,&#8217; answered Barbara, without hesitation.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson was a little startled, but she
did not show it. &#8216;Then I wonder if you can
explain it to me,&#8217; she went on; &#8216;for, do you
know, I find some of it rather difficult to
understand?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara threw back her head and laughed
merrily. &#8216;But I don&#8217;t understand <i>any</i> of it,&#8217;
she cried. &#8216;You have to be grown up to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
understand it, father says. And I&#8217;m not grown
up yet, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; agreed Miss Finlayson. She was
looking distinctly relieved, and the twinkle had
come back again into the depths of her eyes.
&#8216;I shouldn&#8217;t worry about that, though, if I were
you,&#8217; she continued, sitting down and taking the
child on her lap. &#8216;Some day, when you are
quite grown up, you will be able to understand
it; and then we can read it together and help
each other over the difficult parts. What do
you say to that?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I think it will be beautiful; but it&#8217;s a very
long time to wait,&#8217; sighed Barbara. &#8216;When do
you think I shall be quite grown up? Jill is
grown up, and she is eighteen. Shall I be
grown up when I am eighteen?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We will wait and see,&#8217; said Miss Finlayson,
but somehow her tone was not encouraging.
&#8216;Meanwhile,&#8217; she went on, patting the hand
that was fearlessly lying in hers, &#8216;supposing
we make a bargain that neither of us will read
your father&#8217;s book until we can read it together?
You see, if you were to go on reading it now,
you might understand it in quite a wrong way,
and then you would never be able to help me
over the difficult parts.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara thought about it for a moment or
two. &#8216;But <i>you</i> will have to do without father&#8217;s
book all those years!&#8217; she exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have read it once, you see,&#8217; said Miss
Finlayson, gravely; &#8216;I think I can manage to
wait, if you will wait too.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>Barbara still looked doubtful. &#8216;Do you
really think I shall be able to help you over
the difficult parts?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson smiled mysteriously. &#8216;Perhaps,&#8217;
she said. &#8216;One never knows.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then I&#8217;ll wait till I&#8217;m grown up before I
read it again,&#8217; decided Barbara. &#8216;It would
certainly be a pity to spoil father&#8217;s book by
understanding it all wrong.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Or by dropping it from the top of other
people&#8217;s ladders,&#8217; observed Miss Finlayson.
That was all the reproof she gave her; and
then she turned briskly to the writing-table.
&#8216;Isn&#8217;t there something you have written for
me?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>Barbara jumped away from her in dismay.
&#8216;I quite forgot!&#8217; she said penitently. &#8216;I did
begin to write something, and then&#8211;and then<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;
She struggled in vain to remember what
had happened, and gave it up with a sigh. &#8216;I
don&#8217;t know what I did, but I know I never wrote
any more than this,&#8217; she added, and produced
the sheet of paper in a shamefaced manner.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson took it, and glanced at the
title that was written crookedly across the top
of the page. &#8216;A Comparrisson of the Possition
of Women, now and in the eighteenth century,&#8217;
was what she read. Below that came quantities
of smudges and blots, and at the bottom of all
was inscribed: &#8216;These are the ink bogies that
came and wrote the Princess&#8217;s compossition for
her, and saved her from the awfull anger of the
cruel old witch called Finny.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>Miss Finlayson read this over more than
once, then she folded up the sheet of paper
very carefully, keeping her face averted all the
while. Babs was sure she had been very
naughty, and she was seized with a panic lest
the head-mistress should be too angry this time
even to speak to her.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8211;I know it was very naughty of me,&#8217; she
confessed anxiously; &#8216;I couldn&#8217;t think of anything
to say about it, and the pen made such
beautiful bogies, and&#8211;and&#8211;are you <i>awfully</i>
furious?&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson had to look at her, then;
and she made a last effort to keep grave. The
next moment the little room was filled with
her laughter.</p>

<p>&#8216;My dear little girl,&#8217; she exclaimed, &#8216;I am
afraid I am not a bit furious. The fact is&#8211;the
ink bogies <i>have</i> saved the Princess!&#8217;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE BOOTS OF THE HEAD GIRL</span></h2>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m going to be in your class for everything
except Latin and mathematics,&#8217; shouted Barbara,
flying into the juniors&#8217; room just before dinner.
It seemed to her of the first importance that
everybody should know which class she was to
be in, and she was distinctly surprised when
Jean Murray, whom she had addressed, turned
her back on her and began talking loudly to
some one else. &#8216;Don&#8217;t you hear?&#8217; persisted
Babs, coming round in front of her again.
&#8216;I&#8217;m going to be in your class for everything
except<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sneak!&#8217; burst out Jean Murray, unable to
control herself any longer. &#8216;Tell-tale! You
oughtn&#8217;t to be in anybody&#8217;s class, you oughtn&#8217;t!&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara stood stockstill, and looked at her.
All the courage she had regained from her
peaceful morning in Miss Finlayson&#8217;s study
dwindled away again, and left her hopeless of
propitiating these strange schoolgirls, who
seemed determined on being cross with her
whatever she did. Angela knocked roughly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
against her at the same instant, and surprised
her at last into a remonstrance.</p>

<p>&#8216;What have I done?&#8217; she demanded. &#8216;Won&#8217;t
anybody tell me what I have done?&#8217;</p>

<p>No one answered her. The alliance of Jean
and Angela, though Jean was the youngest
and Angela the most empty-headed of all the
children there, meant the existence of a strong
party in the junior playroom; and the poor
little new girl stood a very small chance of
asserting herself against it. They were much
like sheep, both in the upper and the lower
playrooms at Wootton Beeches; and the party
that followed Margaret Hulme in one room
was like the party that followed Jean in the
other. In both cases it only needed some
one a little stronger than the rest to be the
leader; and Jean, in spite of her inferiority in
age, supplied the strength, or what her school-fellows
mistook for it, in a certain doggedness
of temper that pulled them along in her wake.
Most of them found it so unpleasant to be in
her bad books, that she had very little difficulty
in managing them.</p>

<p>Barbara turned appealingly to Angela.
&#8216;Why is Jean so cross with me?&#8217; she asked.
&#8216;I haven&#8217;t done anything to her, have I?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not done anything?&#8217; echoed Angela, looking
over her shoulder for Jean&#8217;s support.
&#8216;Why, you went and told Margaret Hulme
that Jean hadn&#8217;t given you Finny&#8217;s message,
and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sneak! Tell-tale!&#8217; sneered Jean again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>Barbara suddenly looked immensely relieved,
and smiled in a friendly manner at the enemy.
At least this was a misunderstanding that she
could clear up. &#8216;Is that all?&#8217; she cried. &#8216;No
wonder you were cross, if you thought that.
Of course I never said a word about it to
Margaret Hulme, or any one else; I suppose
she guessed, or something. But why didn&#8217;t
you give me the message? It would have
saved such a lot of bother, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; gasped Jean, as though words almost
failed her, &#8216;I never heard such wicked story-telling!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nor I either,&#8217; chimed in Angela, putting
her arm round Jean&#8217;s waist. &#8216;She&#8217;s done
nothing but tell crams ever since she&#8217;s been
here. Come away, Jean, dear; she isn&#8217;t fit to
be argued with.&#8217;</p>

<p>The pair of them marched off, consumed
with righteous wrath, to the other end of the
playroom. Babs, overwhelmed with the incredible
idea that any one should suppose her
capable of telling an untruth about anything,
waited speechlessly for some one to interfere
and take her part. But those of her school-fellows
who had been listening to the dispute
hastily followed the example of their leader,
and ignored her entirely. They did not stop
to think whether they were being just; if the
new girl told stories&#8211;and Jean Murray said
she did&#8211;it was certainly their duty to teach
her a lesson. When they looked for her
presently, to see how she was bearing their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
displeasure, they found she was no longer
there.</p>

<p>Upstairs, in the small, bare bedroom, the
one spot where she felt safe from the intrusion
of horrible wicked people with horrible wicked
thoughts in them, the forlorn little new girl
was covering page after page of the ruled note-paper
Auntie Anna had given her, with an ill-written,
ill-spelt account of her woes.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dear, dear boys,&#8217; she wrote; &#8216;I am very
misserable. Everything is horible. At least,
that is not quite true. Finny is nice she is
like Auntie Anna and Nurse, and I&#8217;ve got a
bedroom of my very own we all have but mine
is one of the nicest becourse it comes at the
corner of the house and looks over a wall into
the orchard and there&#8217;s a plant with bunches of
red beries that climes round my window and
nobody else has red berrys round their window
but only me. Finny has lots of ripping books
in her study and she has father&#8217;s book and she
is very nice but the girls are beests I hate
girls! Girls tell stories and they say you do
things when you don&#8217;t and they are awfull
beests. They laugh at you every time you
open your mouth but I don&#8217;t mind their siliness
so much it&#8217;s their untruthfull hatefullness that
I hate. I have never been so miserable I wish
father had never gone to that beestly America
and I wish Auntie Anna would come and fetch
me back again. Do do ask her to come and
take me away from all those hatefull girls, tell
her how miserabble I am you don&#8217;t know any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
of you what it is to be really misserable, etc.
etc.&#8217;</p>

<p>She had reached about the fifth page of this
wild epistle when her door flew open; and
Ruth Oliver looked in, with a perturbed look
on her good-humoured face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, there you are!&#8217; she exclaimed.
&#8216;Didn&#8217;t you hear the dinner-bell? We&#8217;re half-way
through the first course. Whatever are
you doing?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara began folding up her letter and
forcing it with trembling hands into an envelope.
&#8216;I&#8217;ve been writing home,&#8217; she said, and her
voice quivered. Of course, everything she did
was wrong; but what did dinner matter when
there was her letter home to be written?</p>

<p>&#8216;My dear child, we&#8217;re not allowed to write
letters except on Wednesday afternoons. Make
haste and put the thing away, do,&#8217; said Ruth,
impatiently. The sudden look of distress on
the child&#8217;s face touched her, and she added
more kindly&#8211;&#8216;Well, well, bring it downstairs
with you, Babe, and perhaps Finny will give
you leave to send it to-day. Only, do <i>come</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson not only gave her leave, but
even offered to deliver the letter herself, as she
happened to be going to pay a call near Crofts
that same afternoon. It consoled Babs a little
to feel that the boys would not have to wait
until the morning to learn how miserable she
was; at the same time, her present situation
was no easier to bear, for all the younger girls
took a thoughtless pleasure in talking at her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
whenever Jean was present; and it was not
nice to be with people who made remarks about
her, and yet pretended all the time that she was
not there. The early part of the afternoon at
Wootton Beeches was given up to playing
games in the nine-acre field, which was marked
out, during the winter, into hockey grounds;
and here Babs found herself, soon after dinner,
strolling aimlessly along by the hedge and
wondering what there was about her that made
eighty-seven girls detest her so heartily. When
she suddenly remembered how much she had
looked forward to playing real games with real
schoolgirls, her disappointment was too much
for her, and the tears rolled rapidly down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, here&#8217;s the new girl, Barbara Berkeley.
She&#8217;ll do,&#8217; said a brisk voice behind her, and
the games-mistress descended upon her with a
hasty request &#8216;not to hide away in corners
when she was wanted.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I didn&#8217;t know I was wanted,&#8217; explained Barbara,
following her up the field. &#8216;I never am
wanted, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nonsense! Everybody is wanted at this
school,&#8217; replied the games-mistress, who had a
warm complexion, a breezy manner, and a
vigorous step, all of which, aided by her name
of Burleigh, had secured her the nickname of
Hurly-burly. It never occurred to her that the
new girl was suffering from anything worse
than the ordinary depression natural to her
newness, and she decided immediately that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
best thing to cheer her up would be to make
her run about. In the eyes of Miss Burleigh,
running about was a cure for most things.
&#8216;Here, Charlotte Bigley!&#8217; she called loudly;
&#8216;you ought to have looked after this child
instead of letting her escape. She&#8217;ll do to play
forward on your side. Just put her where you
like, and let&#8217;s begin.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was not much chance, when Miss
Burleigh was about, of letting private feuds
spoil the game of hockey; and under the influence
of her infectious gaiety, the girls even
began to show Babs a certain amount of friendliness.
Perhaps the fact that Jean Murray was
bicycling round the cinder-track, instead of
playing hockey, may have had something to do
with their change of manner, but Babs did not
inquire into that. It was enough for her that
she was allowed, for the first time in her life, to
run about in the open air without a hat; and
she reddened with pleasure when Charlotte
Bigley, the captain of her side, actually complimented
her on the way she ran. Charlotte
was the oldest of the junior girls, and she was
going to be moved into the upper Third next
term; so she always professed to be rather
superior to the leadership of Jean Murray&#8211;especially
when Jean Murray was out of the
way.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll make a very good right wing, when
you&#8217;ve learnt to pass the ball inside instead of
poking at it,&#8217; she observed condescendingly, at
half-time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>A very little was enough to send up Barbara&#8217;s
spirits with a bound, and when the bell rang at
four o&#8217;clock for preparation, she ran indoors
with as buoyant a step as the rest, and even
whistled gaily to herself as she unlaced her
boots in the large cloakroom, where the girls
were taking off their outdoor things. Angela
happened to overhear her, and at once took
upon herself to quench this unseemly appearance
of cheerfulness, and to remind her that
she was still only a new girl.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;d better look sharp and take off the
head girl&#8217;s boots, or you&#8217;ll catch it,&#8217; she advised
her in a threatening tone.</p>

<p>Barbara stopped whistling and became suspicious.
&#8216;Last time I was told to go and do
things for the head girl, it was all humbug,&#8217;
she said. &#8216;I&#8217;m not going to be taken in twice,
so you shut up!&#8217;</p>

<p>Angela under the protection of Jean, and
Angela by herself, were two very different
beings. The unexpected resistance made by
Babs was quite enough to change her bullying
tone into an injured one, and she began to edge
off towards the other girls. &#8216;This isn&#8217;t humbug,
anyhow,&#8217; she said in a milder tone. &#8216;If you
don&#8217;t believe me, go and see; that won&#8217;t hurt
you, whether it&#8217;s true or not. Of course, if you
<i>want</i> to make Margaret jump on you, it doesn&#8217;t
matter to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was certainly something in what she
said, and Barbara heaved a sigh for the complications
of school life. It was so silly, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
felt, so extremely silly to make such a fuss
about the displeasure of the head girl, and to
avoid it by doing such stupid things for her.
Why couldn&#8217;t the head girl take off her own
boots, like every one else? However, it did
not matter much, one way or the other; and
Babs would have taken off anybody&#8217;s boots
to secure a little friendliness in this most
unfriendly of assemblages. So she threaded
her way through the crowd of girls to where
Margaret Hulme stood talking with the
enthusiastic hockey players who formed the
first eleven. She had not begun to take off
her boots, Babs noticed, so perhaps it was
true after all, and the head girl was really
waiting for some one to come and do it for
her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ruth would make a splendid half-back if
she&#8217;d only learn to strike better,&#8217; Margaret was
saying earnestly; &#8216;and if Winifred wasn&#8217;t so
frightened of tackling, we should have quite a&#8211;what
is it, child?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Please, I&#8217;ve come to know if you want your
boots unlaced,&#8217; said Barbara, rather faintly.
She was fully prepared to be laughed at again
for her pains; and, indeed, it did seem a most
ridiculous suggestion to make to any one. But
the head girl treated it as if it were the most
natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course I do. Do you want to do them
to-day?&#8217; was her reply, and she immediately
put her right foot a little forward and went
on talking to her eleven.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>&#8216;Oh, but I don&#8217;t <i>want</i> to take them off,&#8217;
cried Babs, eagerly. &#8216;I only thought<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>But Margaret was too deep in her conversation
to pay any attention to the youngest girl
in the school; and Barbara knelt down unwillingly
and struggled with a stubborn knot
in a muddy bootlace. She had hardly begun
her unattractive task, when some one dropped
suddenly beside her on the floor and laid a hot
hand on hers.</p>

<p>&#8216;You leave the head girl&#8217;s boots alone!&#8217; said
Jean&#8217;s voice in her ear. &#8216;It&#8217;s just like your
interfering ways, to come sneaking up to her
when I wasn&#8217;t looking. Go away and mind
your own business!&#8217;</p>

<p>Now, Babs had just been resenting deeply
the absurdity of her position at the feet of the
head girl. She did not want to take off anybody&#8217;s
boots, and she thought it an exceedingly
stupid thing to do. But to give up her task
because some one came and got cross about it,
was quite another matter. A lurking spirit of
mischief, helped by the exhilaration she still
felt after her two hours in the open air, made
her retain her hold on the knot in the head
girl&#8217;s bootlace.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am minding my own business,&#8217; she retorted
stoutly. &#8216;Ever since I&#8217;ve been here, you and
Angela have dinned the head girl&#8217;s boots into
my ears till I&#8217;m sick of hearing about the stupid
things. Now I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;m not going to stop till
I&#8217;ve done them; so you&#8217;d better go away
yourself.&#8217;</p>

&#8216;What in the name of wonder are you children doing down there?&#8217;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>Jean glanced at her furiously, and Barbara
tugged away at the bootlace and began whistling
again, to show how little she cared whether
Jean was angry or not. Above their heads,
the gossip went on busily about the style of the
first hockey eleven.</p>

<p>&#8216;How about our chances against the Wilford
club next month?&#8217; some one was asking.</p>

<p>&#8216;As to that,&#8217; said Margaret, with confidence,
&#8216;if we only keep our heads we shall have no
difficulty whatever in standing<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>She did not finish her sentence, for at that
instant a violent onslaught on her right foot
put a comical end to it by nearly upsetting her
balance. She just saved herself by seizing the
arm of the nearest girl, and the hockey gossip
came to an abrupt finish.</p>

<p>&#8216;What in the name of wonder are you
children doing down there?&#8217; demanded Margaret,
wrathfully. The knot had come undone
by this time, and Jean was tugging at one end
of the bootlace, while Babs, with an elfish glee
shining in her bright little eyes, was keeping a
firm hold on the other end.</p>

<p>&#8216;You go away,&#8217; Jean was gasping in a
choked voice. &#8216;I&#8217;ve done this for two years,
and I&#8217;m not going to give up doing it now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You told me yourself I&#8217;d got to do it, and
I&#8217;m not going away till it&#8217;s done, so there!&#8217;
laughed Barbara, in reply.</p>

<p>She made another dash at the foot between
them, and the head girl again nearly lost her
balance. &#8216;Stop quarrelling, and leave my foot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
alone, you naughty little wretches!&#8217; cried
Margaret, stamping her disengaged foot vigorously.
Jean, with two years of discipline behind
her, awoke suddenly to the voice of authority
and started to her feet, covered with terror at
the enormity of her offence. But Babs uttered a
yell of delight at finding the victory so easily won.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why don&#8217;t you unlace somebody else&#8217;s
boots?&#8217; she shouted defiantly to her adversary.
&#8216;There&#8217;s lots of boots round here waiting to be
unlaced.&#8217;</p>

<p>Margaret stooped down and lifted her up
bodily, and set her on her feet beside Jean.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now,&#8217; she said sternly, &#8216;what do you both
mean by behaving in this disgraceful manner?&#8217;</p>

<p>Neither of them answered her. Jean hung
her head and looked as if she were going to
cry every minute, and Barbara waited to see
what would happen next. It did not seem to
her that she had done anything so very dreadful,
and she wondered why no one saw how
funny it all was. Ruth Oliver was looking the
other way, so she could not see her face; but
the rest of them seemed just as serious about
it as the head girl herself.</p>

<p>&#8216;Haven&#8217;t you anything to say for yourselves?&#8217;
demanded Margaret.</p>

<p>Hot, angry tears began to well up into Jean&#8217;s
eyes. She never knew she could have hated
any one so much as she hated this new girl
for coming between her and Margaret Hulme.
Barbara caught sight of her tears, and the
desire to laugh suddenly left her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>&#8216;You see, we didn&#8217;t know who had got to
unlace your boots,&#8217; she explained hastily. &#8216;It
isn&#8217;t that it&#8217;s such an awfully jolly thing to
unlace people&#8217;s boots, but<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s it, is it?&#8217; interrupted Margaret,
crushingly. &#8216;Then you needn&#8217;t be in the same
difficulty any more on my account, for in future
I shall unlace my own boots. Now, go away
and do your preparation at once, and don&#8217;t let
me see either of you again for the rest of the
day.&#8217;</p>

<p>Babs went off obediently to find her books,
and she puzzled greatly as she went over the
displeasure of Margaret Hulme. &#8216;Such a
fuss to make about <i>boots</i>,&#8217; she remarked to
Charlotte Bigley, whose bookshelf was next to
hers. But even Charlotte was not proof against
the furious account of the matter that Jean
Murray had just been giving to a sympathetic
circle of friends; and Barbara soon found that
she had quite lost the little popularity she might
have gained in the hockey field by her behaviour
over the head girl&#8217;s boots.</p>

<p>&#8216;I think she must be mad,&#8217; declared Angela,
in the buzz of conversation that preceeded the
call for &#8216;Silence&#8217; from the presiding French
teacher. &#8216;She looked as though she wanted
to kill Jean. I was looking at her all the time,
and I was quite frightened. She ought to be
watched, I&#8217;m certain she ought.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She ought not to be spoken to by any one,&#8217;
wailed Jean, hiding behind an open atlas to
avoid the scrutiny of Mademoiselle, who sat in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
the archway between the two playrooms.
&#8216;Perhaps, if every one leaves her alone she&#8217;ll
learn how to behave like other people.&#8217;</p>

<p>Left alone she accordingly was, since Jean
Murray had so decreed it; and this time there
were no half-measures about it. At tea-time,
and again at the supper table, the girls on
either side of her turned their backs upon her
and talked busily to their other neighbours;
and in the playroom afterwards she found
herself just as scrupulously avoided. It was
decidedly an uncomfortable state of things for
the new girl, as it was meant to be by those
who were responsible for making it; but somehow
the new girl did not seem to mind it
half so much as they would have expected.
All the evening she sat in the corner of the
juniors&#8217; room by herself, and any one would
have said from the look on her face that she
did not care whether the others spoke to her
or not. Now and then she smiled, as she sat
there with her elbows perched on her knees
and her chin supported on her hands; and the
whole time her look of supreme unconsciousness
never left her.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s hardened, that&#8217;s what she is,&#8217; declared
Jean, glancing in her direction. This she said
to keep up her own resentment against the
new girl, which was unaccountably beginning
to cool.</p>

<p>&#8216;She thinks it&#8217;s grand to pretend not to
care,&#8217; added the faithful Angela. This, indeed,
was the prevailing opinion among the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
children of the junior playroom; and it was
not comforting to their pride.</p>

<p>All the while, Barbara guessed nothing of
the comments she was provoking by her manner.
It was enough for her that she had got
away once more into her fairy kingdom, and
that Kit and the magician and the old fairy
godmother had just turned out all the princesses
who were called schoolgirls, and had
shut the gates in their faces.</p>

<p>It was a very weary little new girl who went
up to her bed that evening after prayers. She
was almost too tired to think over the events
that had been crowded into the last twenty-four
hours, almost too sleepy to realise that
this was the close of her first day at school,
the day she had thought would be the happiest
day in her life. Perhaps it was a good thing
she was not able to think too much about anything,
at the end of that first day at school.
The moment Frulein had turned out her light,
she went off into a dreamless sleep that might
have lasted unbroken till the morning, had not
something occurred most strangely to break it.</p>

<p>She did not hear the small pebbles that were
thrown up, one after another, at her window;
it would have taken more than that to rouse
her from her first sleep, though once a handful
of mould and gravel that scattered itself all
over the glass panes made her stir uneasily and
murmur something sleepily. It was just after
this that some one began calling &#8216;Coo-ey&#8217;
softly, on two particular notes; and after this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
had been repeated two or three times, it gradually
worked itself into the waking dream of the
little new girl. At the fourth time, she was
wide awake and listening with all her might.
Another repetition of it, followed by a gentle
whistle that only Peter knew how to blow
through his fingers, took her with a flying leap
to the window. The moon outside was flooding
the world with light and revealing every
secret in the landscape for miles: it flooded
the big nine-acre field beyond the orchard;
it flooded the orchard itself, and the wall that
ran along it, just under her window; and it
showed her five boys sitting astride on the top
of the wall, and five&#8211;no, <i>six</i> bicycles leaning
against the bottom of the wall.</p>

<p>Barbara pushed open the lattice window as
wide as it would go, and leaned out breathlessly.
Her finger was on her lips, and she
shivered from head to foot with cold and the
fear of being overheard. Supposing that any
one were to find out they were there, and
should send them away before she could get
to them?</p>

<p>The five of them made frantic signs of welcome,
as soon as they saw the familiar dark
head appear at the window. In spite of the
graphic description contained in her letter, they
were beginning to be afraid of having besieged
the wrong window. Then Kit waved a screw
of paper and made more signs, and the dark
head vanished from view again. It did not
take a minute to turn out all the contents of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
her corner drawer, and to find the ball of string
that Robin had given her for a parting present,
and then to fling the end of it down to Kit,
who tied on his screw of paper and nodded at
her to haul it up.</p>

<p>The moonlight was bright enough to enable
her to read the few short pencilled lines without
much difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ve come to the rescue,&#8217; she read.
&#8216;Auntie Anna has gone away till to-morrow, so
we could not wait until then, knowing you
were so jolly blue. Come down quickly;
there&#8217;s a window under yours that you could
get through all right.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara struggled with desperate haste into
her pink dressing-gown, thrust her bare feet
into a pair of woolly slippers, and glided to the
door. In her haste and her half-awakened
condition a more elaborate costume than that,
considering the urgency of the occasion, seemed
quite unnecessary to her. Along the silent
gallery she pattered, and down the wide staircase,
then through the two empty playrooms
into the front hall. She knew the window the
boys had meant; she had noticed the red
berries tapping against the glass, as she passed
it on her way to Finny&#8217;s study the morning
before.</p>

<p>As she sped across the moonlit hall, she
did not see that the study door was ajar and
that a chink of light shone out from it. All
her attention was absorbed in the one thought
that the boys were going to take her away from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
this houseful of unfriendly strangers, and that
she would never have to face them and their
taunts again.</p>

<p>She clambered on to the window-seat, and
unfastened the shutter. That was easy enough,
but the bolt of the window baffled her for some
seconds. When she did manage to shoot it
back, the noise it made filled her with apprehension.
In her terror lest she should have
been overheard, she did not pause another
instant, but threw up the sash and hastily put
one slippered foot on the ledge. Once outside
and on her bicycle, the boys would take care
that no one overtook her; and she would be
free at last!</p>

<p>Panting with excitement, she stooped through
the open window and prepared to draw her
other foot after her. But before she had
time to do so, a light step had crossed the
hall and an arm was flung round her from
behind.</p>

<p>&#8216;Barbara!&#8217; exclaimed Miss Finlayson. &#8216;<i>Barbara!</i>&#8217;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN IMPROMPTU SUPPER PARTY</span></h2>

<p>The disappointment was too much. Barbara
covered her face with her hands and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let me go, do let me go!&#8217; she cried, struggling
to free herself. &#8216;It can&#8217;t make any difference
to you whether I run away or not, and
it does matter to me and the boys!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Barbara!&#8217; repeated Miss Finlayson, very
quietly indeed. But the child did not seem
to hear.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why won&#8217;t you let me go?&#8217; she sobbed
passionately. &#8216;I can&#8217;t stop any longer in this
horrible place. Nobody wants me here, nobody!
Do, do let me go back with the boys.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson put her other arm for a
moment round the little figure in the pink
dressing-gown, and she kissed the only place
on the hot, wet cheek that was to be seen.
Then she stepped backwards and left her free.</p>

<p>&#8216;You can go, Barbara, if you want to,&#8217; she
said, just as calmly as before.</p>

<p>Babs uncovered her eyes and looked at her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
incredulously. Now that she was free to go
the inclination to run away seemed to have
left her. Outside, the boys were waiting and
wondering why she did not join them. They
could just see something at the open window,
but the shadow cast by the orchard wall made
it indistinguishable. Miss Finlayson shot one
glance outwards, that took in the row of figures
at the top of the wall, and the row of bicycles at
the bottom of it; then she waited passively for
Barbara to make up her mind. But this was
precisely what the child could not do.</p>

<p>&#8216;Wouldn&#8217;t you&#8211;wouldn&#8217;t you <i>mind</i>?&#8217; she
stammered at last.</p>

<p>&#8216;Would it matter to you if I did?&#8217; asked
Miss Finlayson.</p>

<p>Babs stood still, in a miserable state of indecision,
with one foot still on the window-seat,
and the other placed on the ledge outside.
She was beginning to feel exhausted by the
excitement she had gone through, and she gave
a weary yawn that turned into a shiver. Miss
Finlayson promptly put an end to the situation
by lifting her back into the hall. Directly she
did so, a series of thuds in the neighbourhood
of the wall, followed by the crunch of footsteps
along the gravel path, sounded from without,
and the tops of five heads suddenly appeared
at the open window.</p>

<p>&#8216;If you please,&#8217; said a voice, pleadingly, &#8216;it
is our fault that the Babe is trying to escape.
You won&#8217;t rag her for it, will you?&#8217;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i4'></a><img src='images/illus-108.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8216;Five heads suddenly appeared at the open window&#8217;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>&#8216;She never knew we were coming, till we
came,&#8217; added another voice. &#8216;We made up the
plan because we heard she was jolly unhappy.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We couldn&#8217;t possibly let her be unhappy
another minute, or else we might have waited
till Auntie Anna came back,&#8217; chimed in a third.</p>

<p>Then followed a disappointed cry in Robin&#8217;s
shrill tones. &#8216;But <i>isn&#8217;t</i> she going to escape,
after all?&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson waited till they had finished
speaking, and her large clear eyes were brimming
over with fun.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course she is going to escape, if she
wants to,&#8217; answered the head-mistress; &#8216;but at
present she seems to be in some doubt about
the matter. Supposing you come in and wait
by the fire, while she thinks it over. You
might help her, perhaps, to make up her mind.
Will you climb through the window, or shall I
unbolt the front door?&#8217;</p>

<p>Naturally, a rescue party five strong could
not do anything so tame as to walk through
a front door; so although the window was four
or five feet from the ground, Robin was hoisted
up first by Peter&#8217;s strong arms, and then they
all scrambled after him, one by one, till the
little procession was ready to follow Babs and
her captor into the warm, cosy study. Certainly,
no one could have said that Miss Finlayson&#8217;s
room looked stiff or austere at night,
when the curtains were drawn and the fire had
burned down to a rich red glow.</p>

<p>There was something like an uncomfortable
pause, as soon as they found themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
assembled there, with the light full on their faces.
It was true that the expedition had not failed,
and that the Babe was as free to escape now as
she had been before Miss Finlayson came upon
the scene; but, for all that, none of them could
help feeling that Miss Finlayson, so far, had the
game in her own hands, and that they were
only making themselves look ridiculous. For
they could all see that her face was overflowing
with merriment, as she stooped down and poked
the fire into a blaze.</p>

<p>Egbert cleared his throat, and tried to relieve
the awkwardness of the position by making
some sort of an apology. He knew quite well
that, being the eldest, he ought to have suppressed
the plot in the very beginning.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am afraid you will think us rather mad,&#8217;
he began, &#8216;but the Babe&#8217;s letter put us all on
our mettle; and we thought&#8211;that is, some of
us thought she ought to be rescued. Of course,
we hadn&#8217;t seen you then,&#8217; he added desperately.
Any apology for the rescue party certainly
involved the most unflattering insinuations
about his hostess; and Egbert in his confusion
thought exceedingly bitter things about
Kit and Peter, who had dragged him against
his will on this wild adventure.</p>

<p>&#8216;It was awfully nice of you to think of me,&#8217;
murmured Barbara, but her tone was not so
enthusiastic as it might have been. If only
Finny would stop being so obliging about it,
she was sure she would find it so much easier
to run away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>&#8216;Exceedingly nice!&#8217; echoed Miss Finlayson,
warmly. &#8216;I am only sorry there should be this
delay in carrying out your plan. However,
that is no reason why we should not have something
to eat, while Barbara is making up her
mind. It must be nearly midnight, and I am
starving. Will one of you come and help me
to forage?</p>

<p>Egbert volunteered, with a feeling of relief at
having something to do; and he followed her
out of the room. The moment the door closed,
the children&#8217;s tongues were loosed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dear, dear Babs,&#8217; cried Robin, dancing
round her gleefully; &#8216;you will come away from
the horrid, cross old thing, won&#8217;t you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Finny isn&#8217;t cross, Bobbin; it&#8217;s the others,&#8217;
remonstrated Babs.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, of course you&#8217;re coming, aren&#8217;t you?&#8217;
said Peter, who was impatient to have done
with this inaction and to carry out the glorious
rescue they had planned. The worst of it was
that half its gloriousness seemed to have subsided
before the pleasant manners of the head-mistress.</p>

<p>&#8216;I should think she was coming, indeed!&#8217;
declared Wilfred. &#8216;You don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;m going
to lose two hours of bed for nothing, do you?&#8217;</p>

<p>Christopher, who had been silently observing
Barbara all the while, shook his head slowly.
&#8216;She won&#8217;t come,&#8217; he said gruffly. &#8216;They&#8217;ve
made her different already.&#8217;</p>

<p>A vague feeling of uneasiness crept over
Barbara. Kit was always right; <i>was</i> she different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
already? She gave herself an involuntary
shake. &#8216;Never mind about me!&#8217; she exclaimed.
&#8216;Tell me about Crofts, and what you&#8217;ve been
doing since I left, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>everything. Do you
mean to say your cold is better already, Kit?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; Wilfred hastened to tell her; &#8216;that&#8217;s
because of the new doctor.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s a new doctor just settled in this part
of the world,&#8217; explained Peter. &#8216;Your Finny
thinks an awful lot of him, and that&#8217;s why
Auntie Anna sent for him last night, when Kit
got bad, instead of going to the old-fashioned
chap who lives round the corner at Crofts. <i>We</i>
don&#8217;t think anything of him at all, though; do
we, boys?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He <i>is</i> a funny man,&#8217; commented Robin.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s a beast,&#8217; said Kit, conclusively.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s a clever beast, anyway,&#8217; protested
Wilfred, feeling bound to support the profession.
&#8216;He&#8217;s done you an awful lot of good already,
Kit, and he lets you go out as much as you
like. It&#8217;s the modern treatment, or something.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why is he a beast, Kit?&#8217; asked Barbara,
sympathetically. The world had convinced her
so strongly, since yesterday afternoon, of its
possibilities in the way of beasts, that she felt
sure Kit was right about it.</p>

<p>&#8216;He grunts at you as though you weren&#8217;t fit
to speak to; and he isn&#8217;t a bit sorry for you, as
old Browne used to be, but he seems to think
you are making it all up,&#8217; said Christopher, in
an injured tone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>&#8216;He doesn&#8217;t like boys; that&#8217;s at the bottom
of it,&#8217; added Peter. &#8216;He looked black as
thunder because we were rotting in the library
with Kit, and he cleared us all out before he&#8217;d
even look at his tongue.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And he never sent for a silver spoon, nor
nothing,&#8217; cried Robin, in much excitement.
&#8216;How did he &#8217;xamine your throat, Kit, if he
hadn&#8217;t got a silver spoon?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Shoved a thing like a skewer down, that
he took out of his pocket,&#8217; said Kit, contemptuously.
&#8216;His pocket was full of rotten skewers
and things.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s the modern treatment,&#8217; said Wilfred
again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Modern treatment be hanged!&#8217; remarked
Peter, with a laugh. &#8216;Jill hates him too; he
treated her as if she was about ten years old.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Jill&#8217;s furious because Auntie Anna has
asked him to dinner next week; and we shall
have gone back by then, so she&#8217;ll have him to
herself all the evening,&#8217; chuckled Wilfred.</p>

<p>&#8216;How is Jill?&#8217; asked Barbara, as soon as she
could get in a word.</p>

<p>There was a little pause. &#8216;She&#8217;s all right,&#8217;
said Christopher, indifferently, after a moment
or two.</p>

<p>&#8216;Kit likes her <i>awfully</i>,&#8217; proclaimed Robin,
with his head on one side.</p>

<p>&#8216;So does Peter,&#8217; added Christopher, hastily.
&#8216;He was awfully gone on her this morning,
because she mended his cap when no one was
looking.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>&#8216;I don&#8217;t think she means to be young-ladyish,
really,&#8217; remarked Wilfred, patronisingly. &#8216;Last
night, when you kids had gone to bed, she sang
to Egbert and me. She can sing!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, why didn&#8217;t she sing to us before?&#8217;
demanded Peter. &#8216;That&#8217;s where she&#8217;s so
awfully rum.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She hasn&#8217;t been properly trained, that&#8217;s all,&#8217;
said Christopher.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, she&#8217;s studied under the best master in
Paris!&#8217; interrupted Wilfred.</p>

<p>&#8216;You goat! I meant <i>her</i>, not her singing,&#8217;
snapped Christopher.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, well, we all know why <i>you</i> like her,&#8217;
retorted Wilfred. &#8216;It&#8217;s because she came and
sucked up to you by offering to read aloud to
you, before Dr. Hurst said you might go<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I never said I did like her,&#8217; disputed Kit.</p>

<p>The door opened before they settled the
matter; and the foraging party returned, laden
with spoil.</p>

<p>&#8216;I brought everything I could find that
looked interesting,&#8217; announced the head-mistress.
&#8216;You must be ravenous after riding all that way;
and I&#8217;m sure I am, though I&#8217;ve done nothing
but sit by the fire all the evening and make
time-tables. You might clear them out of the
way for me, will you, Robin? And you,
Wilfred, can move the other things on to the
floor, or anywhere else you like. Will you
hold this tray, Peter, while I lay the cloth?
No, I don&#8217;t want you, Christopher, thank you.
Can&#8217;t you see that Babs is bubbling over with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
news for you? Go and keep her company by
the fire till supper is ready.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was very queer that she should know all
their names like that, and Egbert declared
afterwards that he did not think he had told
her anything about them, though somehow she
had kept him talking all the time they were
foraging in the larder. She had found out as
much as she wanted to know, however, and she
found out a good deal more before supper was
over. There was something about her that
made them all talk to her as if she were an old
friend of theirs instead of the stern jailer whom
they had come to defy. Not that she allowed
them for all that to have the conversation to
themselves, for she chatted away herself as
busily as possible; and she made jokes about
her impromptu supper until even Egbert felt
at his ease.</p>

<p>&#8216;Can any one cut up his chicken without a
knife?&#8217; she asked. &#8216;There&#8217;s a knife short, but
it doesn&#8217;t do to be too particular on an occasion
of this sort, does it? Ah, of course, you have
one in your pocket, Peter; I am used to girls,
you see, and a girl never has anything in her
pocket except a handkerchief, and that is
generally half out of it. Now, who is going to
carve the beef? Not I, indeed! I have
carved the beef in this household for twelve
years, and you needn&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;m going to
miss such an opportunity as this of being idle.
Do you know, there have never been five
gentlemen together at my table since I became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
a schoolmistress? Think of that, Barbara, and
do not wonder that I know more about girls
than tomboys. I&#8217;m sorry there isn&#8217;t a salad,
but there&#8217;s real chutnee from Bombay and not
the other place&#8211;wherever that may be. An
old pupil sends me my chutnee; and I always
keep it for grand occasions, like this and the
break-up party. Will you come to our next
break-up party? That depends, I suppose, on
whether Babs stops here or not. Ah, well, she
will have made up her mind by that time, won&#8217;t
she? I&#8217;m afraid I must forbid you cold pie,
Kit, it&#8217;s poison to asthma; besides, here are
real, stiff, stewed pears. Don&#8217;t you like stewed
pears that are stewed <i>stiff</i>?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara sat on the hearthrug with Kit, and
she tried hard to determine whether she should
run away or not. With Finny revealing herself
in this wonderful new light, and Kit sitting
beside her in the comfortable firelight and
sharing her plateful of stewed pears, the
problem was more than she could solve for
herself. If this was school, she should like to
stay here always; and if it wasn&#8217;t, well, she felt
too lazy in the present delicious state of things
to worry herself any more about it.</p>

<p>Supper came to an end at last, and Miss
Finlayson glanced at the clock. Egbert took
the hint, and pulled Christopher away from the
bookshelves, which he had begun greedily to
examine.</p>

<p>&#8216;I think we must be going,&#8217; said the eldest
of the five, politely; and then he stopped short.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
The absurdity of the situation upset his dignity
again, and he stood there fingering his cap
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8216;What about Babs?&#8217; asked Miss Finlayson;
and her eyes twinkled and shone till one might
almost have supposed them to be filled with
tears.</p>

<p>The boys looked towards the fireplace; but
Miss Finlayson was standing in front of it, and
the little figure in the pink dressing-gown was
hidden from view. The head-mistress, at all
events, had come to the conclusion that the
problem was too difficult for Barbara to
solve.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, what about the Babe?&#8217; said Egbert,
glancing round at the others.</p>

<p>&#8216;We did come to rescue her,&#8217; maintained
Peter, &#8216;and I do think<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Isn&#8217;t Babs coming?&#8217; interrupted Robin, in
tones of amazement. It seemed a great waste
of time to come all this way, and not to rescue
anybody in the end. Of course, there was the
supper to be taken into consideration; but it
would be contrary to all precedent in the
Berkeley family, if the boys were to let themselves
be influenced by <i>supper</i>.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;d be an idiot if she did come,&#8217; muttered
Wilfred, under his breath. He, undoubtedly,
had been influenced by the supper.</p>

<p>Christopher pushed a chair on one side with
a quick, impatient movement. &#8216;She won&#8217;t
come,&#8217; he said once more. Then he caught a
look from his hostess, and reddened slightly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
&#8216;Perhaps she had better stay,&#8217; he added, with
an effort.</p>

<p>&#8216;Thank you, Kit,&#8217; said Miss Finlayson,
with a nod and a smile at him. Then she
turned to the others again. The look of amusement
never left her face once. &#8216;Will some one
ask the Babe what she feels about the matter?&#8217;
she suggested.</p>

<p>She moved on one side to give them the
opportunity. But the question was never put.
Babs had stopped trying to make up her mind;
and the little girl in the pink dressing-gown
was lying curled up on the hearthrug, fast
asleep.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE DISENCHANTMENT OF A BEAST</span></h2>

<p>Barbara was stretched, face downwards, on
the floor of the junior playroom. It was
Wednesday evening, about ten days after the
rescue party had invaded Wootton Beeches;
and she was trying, with the aid of much ink
and a footstool for a writing-desk, to answer
Kit&#8217;s last two letters, and to send him all the
news she had accumulated since that important
occasion. Over her head buzzed the desultory
conversation of her fifty-five companions, who
still gloried in ignoring her; but she heeded
them no more than they had come to heed
the unconscious little person who lay stretched
at their feet. It was really only a habit with
them, by this time, to ignore the new girl; for
most of them had quite forgotten the fancied
grievance they had originally cherished against
her for her defiance of their favourite, Jean
Murray. Indeed, if it had not been for the
fear of Jean&#8217;s scorn and Jean&#8217;s tongue, they
would undoubtedly have made friends with
her days ago. With the best intentions in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
the world, it was not easy to go on avoiding
some one who never seemed to notice that she
was being avoided; and most of them wished
secretly that Jean Murray would &#8216;come round.&#8217;
But whatever Jean felt about it, she showed no
intention outwardly of coming round. Whenever
she found herself alone with a picked
audience, she seized the opportunity to inflame
them and herself afresh, by recalling the evil
behaviour of Barbara over the head girl&#8217;s boots,
pointing out how, by a tissue of deceit, the
offender had wormed herself into Margaret&#8217;s
favour, to the exclusion of other worthier members
of the junior playroom&#8211;notably of Jean
Murray herself. &#8216;You&#8217;ve only got to see how
little she cares, and <i>that</i> will show you what
a wicked mind she&#8217;s got,&#8217; was the kind of
sentence that usually wound up one of these
inflammatory addresses; and after that, the
junior playroom would redouble its coolness
towards Barbara Berkeley. But Barbara
Berkeley persisted in going her own way
cheerfully, as if it were the most natural thing
in the world to live with fifty-five companions
who never spoke to her; and the situation in
the junior playroom threatened to become too
absurd to be maintained.</p>

<p>Babs dropped her pen, and picked up one
of Kit&#8217;s letters for reference. She had so
much to say to him and so little time to say it
in, that she was afraid of leaving some of his
questions unanswered. Kit&#8217;s neat and precisely
written epistle was a great contrast to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
her own blotted and smudged production; and
Barbara sighed as she realised how much he
managed to say in a few words, while she
expended far more time and ink and energy,
without expressing half as much as she wanted
to tell him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dear Babe,&#8217; Kit had written&#8211;&#8216;This is to
tell you that we got home safely from the great
Midnight Rescue Party, though of course I
caught a chill and had to have that beast Hurst
again. I&#8217;ll tell you presently how Jill ragged
him, though; and that was well worth being ill
for. But first of all I have to inform you what
we all think is for your good in the present
crisis of your fortunes. (That means, now you
are at school.) Of course we are much afflicted
to hear that you are not happy, and of course
we are not surprised to hear you do not like
girls. (Nobody could, except Egbert, and he
doesn&#8217;t really, only he pretends he does because
of that chap&#8217;s sister last holidays. That&#8217;s what
has done for Egbert, and it&#8217;s a great pity, but
what we must expect at his age, so it&#8217;s no use
vociferating about it.) But to resume&#8211;we are
all agreed that the best thing you can do is to
stop where you are until the period of probation
is over (that means till you&#8217;ve done being at
school). You see, it is only for three months
at a time, and <i>we</i> are here in the holidays. It
would be indescribable and unprecedented
(which means beastly, and awful, and things
like that) if you had to live with girls in the
vacation too. But you are spared this, and it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
is your duty to be thankful for every crumb of
comfort that is to be substracted from the situation.
(Besides, you are a girl yourself; you
can&#8217;t get over that though you mayn&#8217;t like the
idea, and you&#8217;ve got to go on being a girl till
you&#8217;re a woman. It&#8217;s something to feel that it
can&#8217;t last for ever, and that in the end you will
be able to be a woman, like Nurse and Auntie
Anna; and there&#8217;s nothing the matter with
them, is there?) If your temporary indisposition
only cures your spelling it will be money
well spent, for your spelling, my dear Babe, as
father once said, is both original and varied.
So cheer up, and remember that Jill is but a
girl too, and that she is quite passable for one
of that slack and wayward sex. (Even when
she is most like a girl I find I can bear with
her. For instance, when I lammented the
other day that the rescue party had been a
frost, she said, &#8220;Why, you couldn&#8217;t have
bicycled unless it had been, could you? Listen
to the rain, now!&#8221;) The post is going, so I
must infer the description of how Jill ragged
the doctor till next time. Meanwhile, cultivate
the endurance for which English women have
ever been renowned; that is the result of the
codgitations of the council we held before the
others went back to school.&#8211;Your affectionate
brother,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='sc'>Christopher&nbsp;Berkeley</span>.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>P.S.</i>&#8211;I&#8217;m not quite sure about the m&#8217;s in
lammenting; it looks rum somehow, but there
isn&#8217;t a dictionary, so I must leave it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>His other letter was much longer, and had
evidently been written straight off without the
elaborate care that he had given to the composition
of the first one. As Babs read it, she
pictured him sitting as he always did, perched
on a high chair at the writing-table, with his
legs curled under him and his nose very close
to the paper; and suddenly, the deadly feeling
of home-sickness she had been battling with
for days came over her again.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is the true account,&#8217; she read, through
a suspicious mist in her eyes, &#8216;of how Jill ragged
the doctor, when he came to dine with us, the
day after the boys went back. Of course,
Auntie Anna didn&#8217;t know he was a beast, so
she couldn&#8217;t be blamed for asking him; but Jill
and I much regretted the circumstance. Robin
grumbled and said he wished he was old enough
to sit up to dinner and have courses and courses
and courses, but that&#8217;s his beastly greediness,
as I pointed out to him, and he doesn&#8217;t know
what it is to get a white tie under a filthy clean
collar and then an Eton coat under that and to
wash your teeth extra instead of only in the
morning. But Jill came in and tied it, which
was something, and she even did it better than
Nurse, who used to make you feel sick by
grinding her knuckles into your throat all the
time. Having prepared ourselves for the awful
holocaust we then proceeded downstairs. (Perhaps
you won&#8217;t be able to understand all the
words in this letter, but it&#8217;s too good a joke
to be spoilt by making it easy for you, so you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
must do your best.) Jill had an awfully decent
pink sort of thing on, and it had rows of fringe
that you could tie into knots without her rotting
you for doing it. Well, to come to the real
matter of my discourse, we found the doctor in
the drawing-room, also the old Rector, who is
called Barnaby and is too old to count much,
and besides Auntie Anna likes him so we mean
to extend to him the charm of our companionship.
And the Rector took in Auntie Anna,
and the Beast took in Jill, and I followed behind
feeling rotten. You don&#8217;t know how rotten it
is, when you are an odd one like that and
nobody wants you in their conversation. You
see there were two conversations all the time,
Auntie&#8217;s conversation with the old boy about
tithes and rent charges and things that are not
suited to my intellect, and Jill&#8217;s conversation
with the doctor which wasn&#8217;t a conversation at
all because he wouldn&#8217;t talk. He sat and
glowered at his plate like a cat would, and if he
lifted his eyes by accident and caught one of us
staring at him, he looked down again as if he&#8217;d
been shot. His conduct was most unaccountable
and reprehensible as I pointed out to Jill
afterwards, and she said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and grinned. I
was greatly incensed with him for giving her
so much bother, because she worked hard at
him and never got cross once, and she asked
him about the village and about the poor people
and about abroad, and all those grown-up
things, and the Beast said &#8220;Yes&#8221; and &#8220;No&#8221; and
&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; till I wanted to kick him. I tried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
to help Jill once or twice by tossing off one of
my polite rejoinders, but he only behaved as if
I wasn&#8217;t there and looked more like a poker
than ever. That was what put Jill&#8217;s monkey
up. She couldn&#8217;t stand his indifference and
acidity to me, so she began to rag him and that
shows that she is in reality a brick though forced
to maskerade as a girl. (That&#8217;s another word
you don&#8217;t know perhaps but it&#8217;s in the dictionary.)
She smiled at him as perky as you please and
she said in that soft-cotton-wolly voice of hers,
&#8220;Is there anything that <i>does</i> interest you, Dr.
Hurst?&#8221; And when the Beast was so bowled
over that he nearly dropped his knife and fork,
she just went on and explained how funny it
was to sit all the evening with some one who
didn&#8217;t want to talk, and didn&#8217;t he think so too?
I wanted to break out into paeons of triumph
in order to express my satisfaction at the turn
matters were taking, but I restrained my impetuosity
in time and waited for the Beast to
speak. He stuttered rather and began chopping
up the pear on his plate as if it was for Christmas
puddings, and then he said he didn&#8217;t suppose
any young people were interested in what he
was interested in (which shows that all the
while he lumped Jill and me together as <i>kids</i>
and not fit to associate with him). Then Jill
asked him what he <i>was</i> interested in, and he
said &#8220;Bac&#8211;&#8221; (this is the longest word of all and
I&#8217;m afraid you won&#8217;t find it in the dictionary, at
any rate not in the way I&#8217;m going to spell it)
&#8220;Bacterioi&#8211;&#8221; oh hang! here goes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
again&#8211;&#8220;Bacteriollodgy.&#8221; Then Auntie Anna winked
at Jill, and we went upstairs and left the Beast
with the Rector, which was a punishment he
more than deserved, as I told Jill. She said
she was afraid we boys were spoiling her
manners, and Auntie said, &#8220;Of course they are!&#8221;
as if it was a good thing, which of course <i>we</i>
know it is. I had to go to bed then, and Jill
said it was awful desolation and despair when
I&#8217;d gone, because Auntie Anna began her conversation
all over again with old Barnaby, and
the Beast instead of having the sense to join in
it went and sat with Jill all the evening. Which
shows his puerrility and blightedness. She
sang to him too, and he got up to go the
moment she had finished which was beastly
rude, I think. If he did think she sang badly
he might have played up better. But he&#8217;s a
beast, and you can&#8217;t get over that. He&#8217;s very
ugly and sulky looking, and he&#8217;s about fifty I
should think, but Jill says not so old. That&#8217;s
her grown-up charitableness which she can&#8217;t
get over. Anyhow<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>The mist in Barbara&#8217;s eyes threatened to
become so serious at this point that she put
down Kit&#8217;s letter hastily and returned to her
own. Whatever happened, she was not going
to cry before all these girls, who never understood
anything she did. She was hard at work
again by the time Ruth Oliver pushed aside
the curtain and looked in from the next room.</p>

<p>&#8216;Barbara Berkeley!&#8217; she called. &#8216;Has any
one seen Barbara Berkeley?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>One or two of the girls looked round casually
at the slim figure on the floor, but nobody
roused her. Ruth Oliver was too good-natured
a person to inspire much authority in the junior
playroom, and the children would sooner risk
her displeasure any day than Jean Murray&#8217;s.
If it had been any other girl in the First, half a
dozen of them would have hastened to do her
bidding at once.</p>

<p>&#8216;Angela!&#8217; called Ruth, impatiently, coming
into the room as she spoke; &#8216;don&#8217;t you know
where the Babe is? She has got to go and
see the doctor at once.&#8217;</p>

<p>On the other side of the curtain, both Barbara
and her nickname met with the popularity that
was denied to them in the junior playroom;
and the note of familiarity in the elder girl&#8217;s
words sent Angela&#8217;s impudent chin up in the air.</p>

<p>&#8216;We don&#8217;t know anybody of that name in
here,&#8217; she said, and went on talking flippantly
to the girl beside her.</p>

<p>Ruth Oliver was not born to be a leader,
and she was horribly afraid of some of the
younger ones, who had been quick enough to
detect this long ago, and naturally presumed
upon it. But there were limits even to her
endurance, and she laid a stern hand on Angela&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8216;If you don&#8217;t want to be reported to Margaret
Hulme, you&#8217;d better fetch Barbara to me at
once,&#8217; she commanded, with a firmness she
certainly did not feel.</p>

<p>Angela rose with a very bad grace, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
strolled as slowly as she dared to the other
end of the room. &#8216;If you&#8217;d only said that
at first, it would have saved all this fuss!&#8217;
she muttered, as soon as she was at a safe
distance.</p>

<p>Babs still lay face downwards on the floor,
with her heels in the air and her whole attention
fixed on the paper she was covering with her
large round handwriting. If she did not finish
her letter before the prayer-bell rang, it would
have to wait until next Wednesday. So she
did not take any notice when some one came
and said something or another in her ear. She
was always in somebody&#8217;s way, and if she
moved, she would only be in somebody else&#8217;s
way. So she stayed where she was.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t you hear? You&#8217;ve got to go and
see the doctor,&#8217; repeated Angela, loudly and
with impatience. Thoughtless and empty-headed
as she was, even Angela Wilkins had
the sense to see how absurd it was that the new
girl should turn on her persecutors by ignoring
them.</p>

<p>Barbara rolled over on her side and glanced
up at her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, all right! I know how much of that
to believe,&#8217; she answered; and she rolled
back again into her old position and continued
her letter to Kit.</p>

<p>&#8216;She says she doesn&#8217;t want to see the stupid
doctor, and nothing will induce her to come,
and she doesn&#8217;t care what you say or anybody
else either,&#8217; was Angela&#8217;s version, on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
return to Ruth Oliver, of the way in which
Barbara had received her message.</p>

<p>The elder girl looked down at her suspiciously.
&#8216;Did she really say that?&#8217; she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8216;Go and ask her, that&#8217;s all,&#8217; cried Angela,
full of righteous indignation at having her word
doubted. For she was really under the impression
that she had correctly described the
attitude of the new girl towards the doctor and
Ruth Oliver.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I will,&#8217; answered Ruth, and she
threaded her way among the girls until she
too stood over the prostrate figure of the
offender.</p>

<p>&#8216;Babs,&#8217; she called, bending down.</p>

<p>Barbara flourished her black legs in the
air with an impatient movement. &#8216;How you
do bother!&#8217; she complained, stifling a sigh.
&#8216;That&#8217;s the second in five minutes. Why
can&#8217;t you leave me alone?&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a start of surprise in the group
that surrounded her. It is probable that few
of her listeners saw the ridiculous side of the
new girl&#8217;s request to be left alone, when that
was the punishment that had been meted out
to her ever since her second day at school;
but any one of them could have told her that
that was not the way to speak to a girl in the
First.</p>

<p>Ruth turned a little red from sheer nervousness;
and the girls immediately decided that
she was afraid of the youngest child in the
school, and began to giggle with one accord.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
Barbara sighed again at this new interruption;
and raising herself on her knees, she sat back
on her heels.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s you!&#8217; she observed, shaking the
hair out of her eyes. &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you say so?
I thought it was just some one who wanted to
bother.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ve got to go and see the doctor in
Finny&#8217;s study. Make haste, Babe,&#8217; said Ruth,
who was smarting under the giggle, and wanted
to get back into the other room among her
equals. But the Babe showed no signs of
making haste.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why have I got to see the doctor?&#8217; she
asked, opening her eyes. &#8216;I&#8217;m not ill or anything;
and I want to finish my letter home.
Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s a mistake?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8217; said Ruth, forgetting her
nervousness all at once, and lifting the child
boldly off the floor. &#8216;You&#8217;ve got to be examined
to see if you can do gymnastics, that&#8217;s
all. He&#8217;s in Finny&#8217;s study, waiting for you.&#8217;
She carried her playfully under her arm and
set her down on the further side of the curtain.
Whatever the other tiresome children might
think of her, she knew that the Babe never
criticised her, and that gave her confidence.</p>

<p>Barbara was still a little dubious about the
sense of seeing a doctor when she did not feel
ill; but she trotted across the hall obediently
and went into Finny&#8217;s study. She was only
half conscious of what she was doing, for she
had been taken from her letter too abruptly to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
have had time to wake up properly; and Babs
always required plenty of time to wake up,
when she had been absorbed in anything. So
the solemn-looking young man, who sat in the
low arm-chair, was a little upset when she not
only gave him her hand to shake but also put
up her face to be kissed as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson Hurst, in spite of Kit&#8217;s idea of
his age, was only twenty-eight and quite young
enough to feel extremely bashful. He jerked
back his head suddenly; and Barbara woke
up.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry,&#8217; she said, smiling. &#8216;I
wasn&#8217;t thinking. Of course you don&#8217;t want to
be kissed; I shouldn&#8217;t have dreamed of kissing
you at home, you know, because the boys feel
just like you about kissing. But Ruth kisses
me such lots, and everybody seems to kiss
everybody else here, so I suppose I&#8217;ve rather
got into the way of<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>Here Miss Finlayson said &#8216;Hush!&#8217; very
softly; and the doctor pulled something so
queer and interesting out of his pocket at the
same time, that Barbara forgot everything else.
&#8216;What are you going to do with that funny
thing? Is it a speaking-tube?&#8217; she asked
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m going to see whether your heart is in
the right place,&#8217; answered the doctor, and he
was immediately so overcome at his stupendous
levity in making a joke over a medical examination,
that he did not speak another word till
it was completed. As for Babs, she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
immensely interested the whole time, and never
took her bright little eyes off his face once.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it in the right place?&#8217; she asked him,
when he put the queer-looking thing back in
his pocket again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said the doctor, briefly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is anybody&#8217;s in the wrong place?&#8217; pursued
Babs, leaning against his knee in the most
friendly way imaginable.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sometimes,&#8217; said the doctor. He marvelled
at himself for not feeling more irritated by her,
when as a rule he found children so worrying.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is yours in the right place?&#8217; persisted
Barbara.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8211;I hope so,&#8217; said the doctor, struggling
with a grim smile.</p>

<p>&#8216;Same place as mine?&#8217; continued Barbara,
eagerly.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson put out her hand to stop
her; but Babs did not see. The doctor saw,
and did not take any notice.</p>

<p>&#8216;I imagine it is in the same place,&#8217; he said
feebly.</p>

<p>&#8216;But how do you know, unless some one
else finds it for you?&#8217; inquired Babs. &#8216;You
can&#8217;t listen to your own heart through that
funny thing, can you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;N&#8211;no, some one else has to find it,&#8217; admitted
the doctor, and she supposed he had
remembered something that made him feel shy,
for he coloured furiously and rose to his feet
rather hurriedly.</p>

<p>Babs stood gazing up at him attentively,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
while he exchanged parting words with Miss
Finlayson. &#8216;It&#8217;s an awful pity you didn&#8217;t go
to see Kit when he was ill,&#8217; she remarked,
directly there was an opportunity. &#8216;Kit&#8217;s
doctor was a beast.&#8217;</p>

<p>The long oval face turned slightly red
again; and Miss Finlayson said something
very quickly about the wet evening.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; replied the doctor, stammering a little;
&#8216;I am sorry the evening is so late,&#8211;so wet, I
mean, and that I am so late in calling&#8211;positively
the first minute I&#8217;ve had to-day,&#8211;extremely
busy this time of year<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>A hand was stealing inside his, and he had
to stop and look down again. &#8216;Do you think
you could go and see Kit next time he is ill?&#8217;
asked Babs, appealingly. &#8216;It isn&#8217;t nice to have
a beast for a doctor, when you&#8217;re ill, is it?&#8217;</p>

<p>The doctor went on looking down at her
with an odd sort of smile on his face. &#8216;That
reminds me,&#8217; he said&#8211;though how it reminded
him the child could not for the moment imagine&#8211;&#8216;that
your cousin Miss Urquhart charged me
with a message for you. She sent you her
love and promised to write soon. I hope I
have given it correctly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh!&#8217; cried Barbara, with great excitement.
&#8216;Do you know Jill?&#8217; The doctor kept hold of
her hand and nodded. &#8216;And Auntie Anna?
And the boys&#8211;<i>all</i> of them? Then you must
know Kit!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Dr. Hurst, grimly. &#8216;I was the
beast.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>Then he stooped and kissed her cheek very
stiffly, as if he were not used to kissing people;
and then he went away. Like Ruth Oliver, he
had found it difficult to feel nervous of the
youngest girl in the school.</p>

<p>Barbara climbed on the window-seat, and
flattened her nose against the window-pane,
and watched the lamps of the doctor&#8217;s trap receding
down the drive. &#8216;I like doctors; don&#8217;t
you, Miss Finlayson?&#8217; she inquired, when that
lady came back into the study.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson agreed that she liked doctors
very much indeed, and she began to write
something in a big book, while Babs knelt on
the window-seat and stared out into the rain
and the darkness. Suddenly she jumped down
from her perch with a cry of dismay.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8217; asked the head-mistress,
absently.</p>

<p>&#8216;I must have called him a beast!&#8217; gasped
Barbara.</p>

<p>&#8216;I think I heard something like it,&#8217; observed
Miss Finlayson, still writing.</p>

<p>&#8216;But&#8211;but I didn&#8217;t mean that <i>he</i> was a
beast,&#8217; proceeded Barbara, looking distressed.
&#8216;I meant that somebody else was a beast. It
wasn&#8217;t my fault that somebody else was <i>him</i>,
was it, Miss Finlayson?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It would be safer, I think, and perhaps a
little more considerate, not to call anybody a
beast,&#8217; remarked the head-mistress, gravely.
&#8216;Then these little mistakes would be avoided.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I never will again,&#8217; sighed Babs. &#8216;It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
such a particular pity, because he isn&#8217;t a bit
like a real beast, is he?&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson looked up while she dried
the page she had just written. &#8216;Have you
finished your letters home?&#8217; she inquired
pleasantly. &#8216;The prayer-bell will ring in
about a quarter of an hour.&#8217;</p>

<p>The reminder sent Barbara straight out of
the room, and she sped swiftly back across the
hall, thinking busily. Clearly, the only reparation
she could make to the doctor was to transform
him from a beast into a fairy prince, and
to offer him a place in her fairy kingdom; but
he would be rather lonely there without a
princess, she feared, and she herself already
belonged to Kit. It was always easier to find
princes than princesses, and she did wish that
Finny would not wear a cap and scrape her
hair back so tidily&#8211;two things which disqualified
her, in spite of her niceness, from being a
princess in anybody&#8217;s kingdom. However,
perhaps he would not mind doing without a
princess just at first; and in time she might be
able to find some one who was neither silly nor
unkind, and would be worthy of a crown and
the companionship of a disenchanted beast.</p>

<p>At this point in her reflections Barbara
reached the door of the senior playroom, and
the sight of the elder girls, as they busied
themselves with their weekly correspondence,
reminded her again of her letter to Kit. For
the moment, as far as she was concerned, her
new prince would have to whistle for a princess.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE BABE&#8217;S &#8216;FURY&#8217;</span></h2>

<p>In the junior playroom Jean Murray had been
taking the opportunity to revive the animosity
against the new girl.</p>

<p>&#8216;Can&#8217;t you see that she&#8217;s laughing at us all?&#8217;
she exclaimed to a circle of humble listeners.
&#8216;It&#8217;s all very well to pretend to be such a baby;
that kind of thing may go down with the elder
ones, but it won&#8217;t do here. Anybody can see
that she&#8217;s only putting it all on, to be aggravating.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She told a story the very day she arrived,&#8217;
chimed in Angela from behind. &#8216;A girl who
could do that would do anything.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can&#8217;t you leave the child alone?&#8217; suggested
Charlotte Bigley, who happened to be listening.
&#8216;She seems such a harmless infant to me. I
don&#8217;t believe she even knows she is supposed
to be in disgrace.&#8217;</p>

<p>It required a good deal of courage to stand
up alone against all the girls in the junior playroom,
and Charlotte flushed a little when they
all laughed at her.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s where her artfulness comes in,&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
declared Jean. She thought she heard her rival&#8217;s
voice on the other side of the curtain, and
jealousy made her more bitter than before.
&#8216;If you ask me, I believe she only pretends
not to notice any of us, so as to pick up everything
she can; and then she goes and sneaks
it all to the elder ones.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Jean!&#8217; remonstrated Charlotte.</p>

<p>Jean looked a tiny bit ashamed of herself.
It was not nearly so easy to say unkind things
about the new girl as it had been a week ago.
All the same, her unhappiness at the continued
coldness of Margaret Hulme was quite genuine,
and it hurt her sorely to think that the head
girl was now smiling on the interloper as she
used to smile upon her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, it&#8217;s true!&#8217; she vowed. &#8216;I vote we
don&#8217;t leave her alone, or give her the chance
of mocking at us, any more. She wants to be
taught that she&#8217;s the youngest girl in the school,
and that it isn&#8217;t anything to be cocky about.
Anybody who likes can make up to her, as the
big girls do; but <i>I</i> am going to see that she
keeps in her place.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What a fuss to make about an innocent
brat like that,&#8217; remarked Charlotte, smiling
scornfully. &#8216;It&#8217;s jealousy, because Margaret is
kind to her: that&#8217;s all it is!&#8217;</p>

<p>That was decidedly what it was, but it did
not soothe Jean&#8217;s temper to be told so in this
blunt manner; and by the time her rival came
in from the seniors&#8217; room, the enemy had been
worked up into a fine state of resentment against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
her. Unconscious as ever that there was anything
unusual in the atmosphere of the junior
playroom, Barbara slipped through the girls
who were standing about, and reached her
footstool and her letter almost before they
noticed that she had returned. There seemed
to be some wrangling going on between Jean
Murray and Charlotte; but Jean Murray was
always wrangling with some one about something,
and Babs paid no more attention to it
than to the sudden hush that followed as she
dropped down in her old position on the floor.
It was a good thing, she thought, that nobody
talked just then, because there was so little
time left in which to finish her letter. She
took up the pages she had written and glanced
over them.</p>

<p>&#8216;Thank you awfuly much for your advice,&#8217;
she had scrawled in her large childish hand.
&#8216;I am cheering up lots and now that I don&#8217;t
take any notice of the girls and their awfull
siliness it is quite nice being here but not nearly
so nice as being at home with you and father
all of which is now burried for ever alass in
my past. I don&#8217;t hate girls like I did at first.
At first they were always bothering and asking
quesstions and being inquissitive but now they
leave me alone and never talk except when
they want the salt or the butter or haven&#8217;t
heard the number of the psarm at prayers or
can&#8217;t do their algibra I have lots of algibra to
do because girls aren&#8217;t good at algibra I don&#8217;t
think so I always do their algibra for them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
Girls are no fun like boys but as long as they
don&#8217;t say horible things to me like they did at
first I think I shall be able to bear them all
right but its rather dull excep when we play
hockey I&#8217;m getting on at hockey Hurly-Burly
says and she says I shall play in matches some
day and she&#8217;s a brick and I like her. We
haven&#8217;t had any gym yet because the gymnasiam
is being painted but we&#8217;re going to begin to-morrow
and I&#8217;m longing to begin they can&#8217;t
laugh at my short skirts at gym because everybody&#8217;s
skirt is short at gym and its red and
very becomming Ruth says Ruth is Ruth Oliver
and she&#8217;s a big girl and she hooks up my frocks
and kisses me she kisses me rather a lot but
it&#8217;s Ruth Oliver so I can put up with it.
School is very nice when it&#8217;s games or algibra
or latin but it&#8217;s horrid when its dictation or
geography or coppies Finny says I must try
so I am trying but I wish I wasn&#8217;t such an
ignorrant girl I heard Jean Murray say yesterday
I was the most ignorrant girl that ever
came inside this house but praps that was
because I had seventeen speling faults.&#8217;</p>

<p>She sighed as she dipped her pen in the ink
again. That was all she had said, after writing
nearly all the afternoon and evening. And she
had so much more to say, and there was so
little time left before prayers!</p>

<p>&#8216;I have just seen the doctor who is a Beast
and he isn&#8217;t a Beast,&#8217; she had written laboriously
on a fresh page, when Jean Murray stooped
over her and shook her vigorously by the arm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>&#8216;Oh, dear!&#8217; sighed Babs, feeling in her
pocket for the handkerchief that so rarely
seemed to be in it. &#8216;There&#8217;s another blot,
and I&#8217;m in such a hurry!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s no use losing your temper about it,&#8217;
said Jean. &#8216;You&#8217;ve got to get up from the
floor and fetch a desk, if you want to write
letters.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara looked up in mild surprise. &#8216;But
I&#8217;m not losing my temper! Are you sure you
don&#8217;t mean <i>you</i> when you say me?&#8217; she asked
with a spice of mischief in her tone.</p>

<p>&#8216;There!&#8217; said Jean, turning triumphantly to
the attendant Angela. &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I say she was
only laughing at us? Now, look here,&#8217; she
continued, turning again to Babs, &#8216;you&#8217;ve got
to remember that you&#8217;re the youngest in the
school<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, don&#8217;t!&#8217; interrupted Babs, putting up
her hands to her ears. &#8216;You&#8217;ll begin about
the head girl&#8217;s boots next.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was the most luckless thing she could
have said, for it convinced Jean more than
ever that the new girl was bent on making
game of her most serious feelings.</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall say anything I choose,&#8217; she retorted
hotly. &#8216;Get off the floor at once, will you?
We don&#8217;t want ink spilt all over the place; this
isn&#8217;t a nursery.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s spilling ink all over the place?&#8217;
asked Barbara, without moving. All the mischief
that was in her rose uppermost when any
one spoke to her like that.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>&#8216;You are, of course,&#8217; returned Jean, shaking
her again. &#8216;You&#8217;re so badly brought up that you
don&#8217;t know how to behave in a civilised house.
You&#8217;re nothing but a young savage; I heard
Margaret Hulme say so, directly you arrived&#8211;there!
It&#8217;s easy to see you&#8217;ve never had any
one to look after you.&#8217;</p>

<p>The mischievous look died out of the child&#8217;s
face, and she gathered up her papers and
scrambled slowly to her feet. The boys would
have known that such lamblike behaviour was
only the prelude to one of the Babe&#8217;s &#8216;furies&#8217;;
but Jean thought she had succeeded at last in
subduing her, and she became exultant.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s time that some one civilised you,&#8217; she
remarked scornfully. &#8216;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve been
brought up properly, and not neglected like
you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara flashed round upon her suddenly.
&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter with my bringing-up?&#8217; she
demanded in a breathless voice. &#8216;My father
brought me up, and no one in the whole world
could have brought me up better than he has.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That accounts for it,&#8217; scoffed Jean. &#8216;Fathers
can&#8217;t bring anybody up, especially girls. I&#8217;ve
heard mother say so, lots of times.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara&#8217;s eyes were glittering brightly. &#8216;My
father can,&#8217; she answered swiftly. &#8216;My father
isn&#8217;t like other people&#8217;s fathers. You shouldn&#8217;t
judge my father by your father. I don&#8217;t expect
your father to be clever because mine is,
do I?&#8217;</p>

<p>The implied insult was quite accidental on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
her part, in spite of the anger that was growing
in her; but Jean could not be expected to
know that.</p>

<p>&#8216;How dare you say that my father isn&#8217;t
clever?&#8217; she cried indignantly. &#8216;My father is
a professor at Edinburgh, so there!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My father writes books,&#8217; answered Babs,
proudly. &#8216;It&#8217;s much more wonderful to write
books than to be a professor, because everybody
all over the world hears of you if you
write books.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That depends on whether they&#8217;re good
books,&#8217; argued Jean, warmly. &#8216;You <i>have</i> to be
clever if you want to be a professor, but any
stupid person can write a stupid book, and
nobody ever hears of that kind of book at all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Everybody has heard of my father&#8217;s book,
though, so that shows how little you know
about it,&#8217; replied Barbara. &#8216;The people in
America liked his book so much that they
asked him to go all the way to America to
lecture about it. The people in America never
asked <i>your</i> father<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is your father called Everard Berkeley?&#8217;
asked Jean, suddenly. She had not listened to
grown-up conversations in the Christmas holidays
for nothing, and she thought she saw her
way at last to crushing the irrepressible new
girl, once and for all.</p>

<p>Babs nodded. She was too proud to say
anything. What other girl in the room had a
father who was so celebrated that people knew
him by his Christian name, instead of calling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
him just <i>Mr.</i> Somebody? She had only a
short time in which to enjoy her triumph, however,
for Jean Murray turned quickly on her
heel, and walked off with a swaggering step.</p>

<p>&#8216;Then my father says that your father is a
failure over here,&#8217; she answered, tossing her
head contemptuously. &#8216;Nobody will read his
old book in England; so he was <i>obliged</i> to go
to America.&#8217;</p>

<p>The other girls were beginning to notice the
dispute, and they came crowding round to hear
what it was all about. Most of them were in
time to see Jean Murray walk off with her head
in the air, just as the little new girl clenched
her fists and crouched down as if to make a
spring. Then the storm broke, and the Babe&#8217;s
fury was let loose among the fifty-five occupants
of the junior playroom.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter, in that spring forward,
to send some half dozen or so spinning out of
her way, but Barbara did not stop to see what
happened to them. All she wanted to do was
to reach the arch offender of them all, the one
who had dared to slight her father, and to hold
him up to the ridicule of fifty-five girls.</p>

<p>Nobody quite knew what did happen on
this unexampled occasion in the annals of
Wootton Beeches; and certainly nobody stirred
a finger to put a stop to it. All that the girls
in the senior playroom could tell about it
afterwards was that a sudden scuffle and several
screams broke the hush and hum of voices on
the other side of the curtain; and then Angela
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
Wilkins dashed through the archway with a
terrified look on her face, and seized Margaret
by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, come! do come!&#8217; she sobbed out in her
fright. &#8216;Barbara Berkeley has got Jean Murray
down on the floor, and she&#8217;s <i>killing</i> her!&#8217;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE END OF THE FEUD</span></h2>

<p>When the prayer-bell rang that evening, it
interrupted a wild tumult in the junior playroom.
The elder girls had rushed through the
curtain, on the terrified summons of Angela
Wilkins; and the whole school crowded and
thronged round a confused heap in the middle
of the floor. Nothing much was to be seen
except two lanky black legs, a crumpled white
frock, and a good deal of untidy brown hair;
and at first nobody did anything but stare
and exclaim. The ringing of the prayer-bell,
however, brought them all to their senses.
Margaret Hulme made a sudden dash at the
two combatants, picked up the one that came
first, and dropped her in a corner of the room,
where she could be hidden from view until she
had time to recover herself. Then the head
girl turned to the child who still lay sobbing
and gasping on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8216;You get up and behave yourself!&#8217; she said
in a stern undertone; and Jean Murray struggled
to her feet and went off snivelling, to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
comforted by the trembling and excited Angela.
Then the elder girls melted away again into
their own room, and a kind of uneasy hush
settled down on the eighty-seven inhabitants of
Wootton Beeches.</p>

<p>Barbara rubbed her eyes and stared wildly
round her. A solid wall of girls stood between
her and the scene of the recent scuffle; she
could not see what had become of her victim,
and at first she did not even realise what was
producing this wonderful calm. Then the girls
in front of her began slowly to move away
towards the archway; and once she caught a
glimpse through the curtain of the door in the
room beyond. It was only a glimpse, for the
girls closed up again immediately; but it was
enough to show her the stately figure of Miss
Finlayson, as she stood and wished her pupils
good-night, one by one. Barbara had watched
the same ceremony for a good many evenings
now, but it had never seemed quite so orderly
or so solemn before. To-night, it made a peculiar
impression on the wild little tomboy who
had been brought up without discipline or control,
and the strangeness and the misery of her
position overwhelmed her as with a new feeling.
At the same instant, in striking contrast to the
dismal reality, came the remembrance of the
dream she had dreamed all her life about this
very place called school; and, unnoticed by her
school-fellows, who were fully occupied in trying
to behave as if nothing had happened, she
broke down and sobbed bitterly in her corner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>The stream of girls that had been filing
past Miss Finlayson came to an end at last;
but Miss Finlayson did not follow them immediately
to the chapel. Far away, in a distant
corner of the junior playroom, crouched
a dishevelled little girl in a crumpled frock,
weeping dolefully for a dream that had never
come true; and Miss Finlayson stood and
waited in her place by the door.</p>

<p>A sense of the extreme stillness, now that
the footsteps of the girls had ceased, slowly
impressed itself upon Barbara; and she looked
up with a new feeling of alarm. There,
through the opening in the curtain, she could
see the stately figure of the head-mistress in
the room beyond; and Babs thrust a round,
inky ball of a handkerchief into her pocket,
and hastened towards her in a panic.</p>

<p>&#8216;I didn&#8217;t know you were waiting for me,&#8217;
she said, fighting to keep the quiver out of
her voice. &#8216;I didn&#8217;t know they had all gone.
I&#8211;I&#8217;d forgotten it was prayers now.&#8217;</p>

<p>She knocked over a chair as she stumbled
across the room, and once her dress caught on
the edge of a desk and stopped her; but Miss
Finlayson waited with her hand out, and the
little new girl reached her at last. Once more,
behind the grave glance of the blue-grey eyes,
lurked a suggestion of something softer and
more human, and it gave Barbara a little
courage.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wasn&#8217;t crying because I was sorry I&#8217;d
thumped Jean Murray,&#8217; she burst out. &#8216;I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
not a bit sorry, not a <i>bit</i>! I&#8217;d like to thump
her again for saying&#8211;for saying<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>It sounded uncommonly like telling tales,
and she had to stop. Miss Finlayson still had
hold of her hand, and still looked down at her
with the mixture of expressions on her face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you coming up to prayers, Babs?&#8217; was
all she said.</p>

<p>Barbara had not even heard the question.
She was full of her grievance against Jean
Murray, which she had almost forgotten for
the minute; and she burst out again, more
angrily than before.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t you understand?&#8217; she cried passionately.
&#8216;I wasn&#8217;t crying for <i>that</i>; it&#8211;it was
something else, but I can&#8217;t tell you what it was,
because you&#8217;d only laugh. They all laugh&#8211;except
when they&#8217;re just being horrible! Why
didn&#8217;t you let me run away last week? I don&#8217;t
want to stop with people like Jean Murray, and&#8211;and
all the rest of them; I hate being here,
I hate the girls, I hate you! Why won&#8217;t you
let me go away?&#8217;</p>

<p>She hardly knew what she was saying. She
had not been in such a passion since the dreary
day, two years ago, when they took her nurse
away from her, and she had made herself ill
with fretting.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson tightened her grasp on the
hand that was struggling to free itself; then
she bent over her rebellious little pupil, and
laid her other hand against her burning cheek.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you coming up to prayers, Babs?&#8217; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
repeated. Her persistence began to take effect,
and the cool touch of her fingers was very
soothing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why&#8211;why won&#8217;t you let me go away?&#8217;
sobbed Babs, and the tears rained down her
cheeks again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why?&#8217; echoed Miss Finlayson, producing
a handkerchief that had not been used, like
Barbara&#8217;s, to mop up ink blots. &#8216;Because I
want you myself, to be sure.&#8217;</p>

<p>She dried the child&#8217;s eyes as she spoke; and
the small tear-stained face looked up at her
wistfully. &#8216;Do you want me?&#8217; asked Barbara.
&#8216;Does anybody want me&#8211;<i>truthfully</i>?&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson nodded, and a look slowly
deepened in her face that gave the child
confidence. &#8216;Yes, Babs, truthfully,&#8217; she answered.
Then she repeated for the last time,
&#8216;Are you coming to prayers?&#8217; And keeping
the hot little hand within hers, she led her
upstairs to the chapel.</p>

<p>At Wootton Beeches the girls always walked
in and out of chapel in the order of their
classes, beginning at the top of the school.
But, this evening, the youngest child in the
school walked out in front of everybody, for
Miss Finlayson held her by the hand and would
not let her go. They stood together, a curiously
assorted couple, at the end of the passage
that led to the other wing of the house;
and one after another the girls passed them on
their way to their rooms. There was not a
sound for some moments, except the tapping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
of footsteps on the polished boards; then, walking
last of all, came Jean Murray. Babs broke
from her companion and flung herself impetuously
forward.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, I&#8217;m awfully sorry I thumped you on
the head just now,&#8217; she began, and held out her
hand invitingly to the enemy. &#8216;I wasn&#8217;t a bit
sorry at first, and I wanted to do it again,
<i>frightfully</i>; but I am sorry now, and I don&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

<p>The girls who were still in the passage
lingered, and looked back. Evidently, there
was no end to the sensations that Barbara
Berkeley meant to produce in her first term
at school.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hush!&#8217; whispered Jean, glancing round
timorously at the head-mistress.</p>

<p>Babs looked amazed. &#8216;Won&#8217;t you shake
hands?&#8217; she asked. &#8216;I know I thumped you
awfully hard, but still<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sh-sh!&#8217; repeated Jean, trying to push past
her. &#8216;Don&#8217;t you know we&#8217;re not allowed<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I think&#8211;I <i>do</i> think you might make it up,&#8217;
continued Babs, in a disappointed tone. &#8216;Even
if I did hurt you rather, you must own you were
very mean.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean Murray, feeling the eyes of authority
fixed upon her, made another attempt to escape.
&#8216;Can&#8217;t you wait till to-morrow?&#8217; she asked in
an agitated whisper.</p>

<p>&#8216;I should have waited, if it hadn&#8217;t been for
that hymn,&#8217; answered the child, still barring the
way obstinately. &#8216;I can&#8217;t help it if the hymn
made me feel funny without making you feel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
funny too, can I? I can&#8217;t think what there
was about that hymn,&#8217; she added to herself reflectively;
&#8216;I never remember noticing a hymn
so much before.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson came up to them, and Jean
fairly quaked. If there was a rule that the
head-mistress was strict about, it was the rule
of silence after prayers. Jean knew, for she
had been unlucky enough to break it more
than once.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have changed your room, Jean,&#8217; said Miss
Finlayson, calmly. &#8216;Angela will have yours for
the rest of the term, and you are to sleep in
number fourteen, next door to Ruth Oliver. I
have just told Angela, so you can go straight
to her old room now, and I will send up one of
the servants to move your things for the night.
The rest can be done in the morning. By the
way,&#8217; she added, as she left them, &#8216;you three
may talk till the lights are put out; for it seems
that Barbara has something to say that will not
keep until to-morrow. Good-night.&#8217;</p>

<p>She walked away downstairs with a deliberate
step; and the two children were left standing
together on the landing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I never!&#8217; exclaimed Jean, staring
after Miss Finlayson.</p>

<p>But Babs was less concerned with the
peculiarities of the head-mistress than with her
own immediate business. &#8216;How much longer
are you going to be before you shake hands?&#8217;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8217; answered Jean,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
awkwardly, and she at last put a limp hand into the
one Barbara was tired of pressing upon her.
They trotted along the passage side by side,
Jean feeling a little overwhelmed by the suddenness
of the reconciliation, while Babs wondered
what had happened to make her so silent all at
once. To her it seemed the most natural thing
in the world to be on good terms with the enemy
whose head you had just thumped, provided
that you had apologised suitably afterwards;
and she chatted away cheerfully until Jean was
obliged to stifle her inclination to be dignified.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say,&#8217; said Babs, when they reached the
gallery in the other wing of the house and were
hurrying round it to their rooms; &#8216;shall I be
punished a lot for knocking you down this
evening?&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean recovered some of her self-assurance.
If she was to be denied the pleasure, in future,
of persecuting the new girl, there was no reason
why she should not still patronise her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Punished!&#8217; she echoed. &#8216;That&#8217;s all you
know about it. Nobody is ever punished here.&#8217;</p>

<p>It took Barbara a moment or two to get used
to this new idea, and by that time they had
reached their rooms. She returned to the
subject soon after, however, when Ruth had
opened the doors that led from her room into
both theirs, so that they could talk across her
if they liked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Can you be as naughty as you choose in
this school?&#8217; demanded Babs, in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t advise you to try,&#8217; remarked Ruth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>&#8216;Why not? What would happen if I did?&#8217;
asked Babs, curiously.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, you&#8217;d feel jolly small, and have to
come round in the end and behave like other
people,&#8217; said Jean, raising her voice to make
herself heard.</p>

<p>Barbara wandered into Ruth&#8217;s room to have
her frock unfastened, and continued the discussion
from there.</p>

<p>&#8216;Then, is being good at school the same
thing as behaving like other people?&#8217; she said
doubtfully.</p>

<p>The others seemed to have some difficulty
in answering this. &#8216;There!&#8217; said Ruth, giving
her a little push; &#8216;make haste and get undressed.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara wandered back into her own room
again, and thought it over carefully. &#8216;Being
good at home wouldn&#8217;t be the same thing as
behaving like other people,&#8217; she observed
presently.</p>

<p>&#8216;Home isn&#8217;t school,&#8217; answered Ruth. &#8216;And
Finny&#8217;s school isn&#8217;t like other people&#8217;s schools,&#8217;
she added.</p>

<p>&#8216;Isn&#8217;t it?&#8217; said Babs, with interest. &#8216;Where&#8217;s
the difference?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ask Jean,&#8217; replied Ruth; and Jean took up
the tale from beyond.</p>

<p>&#8216;I was at another school before I came here,
and it was very different, I can tell you,&#8217; she
remarked. &#8216;There were nothing but rules there,
and you always seemed to be breaking one or
another of them, without knowing it; and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
you got punished. I was punished the whole
time I was there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What sort of punishments?&#8217; asked Barbara.</p>

<p>&#8216;Stupid punishments,&#8217; answered Jean,
vaguely. &#8216;Punishments that made you feel
foolish, and made you hate people. I did hate
a lot of people at that school. I thought I
was awfully wicked because I hated so many
people. And then I came here,&#8217; she wound up
triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8216;And did you find you were good when you
came here?&#8217; asked Babs.</p>

<p>&#8216;You shut up and get yourself ready for bed,
or else Frulein will catch you,&#8217; was all Jean
said in reply to this.</p>

<p>Barbara gave one or two perfunctory taps to
her head with a brush. &#8216;I suppose that&#8217;s why
we&#8217;re left so much to ourselves,&#8217; she remarked,
after a pause. &#8216;We never see the teachers
except at meals or in lesson time, do we?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course we don&#8217;t,&#8217; replied Ruth; &#8216;that&#8217;s
where Finny&#8217;s school is so different, you see.
In most schools you are being watched all day
by some one or another, and it makes you
whisper because you don&#8217;t want to be overheard.
Nothing makes Finny so furious as to
catch any one whispering.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is she ever furious?&#8217; inquired Barbara.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t be a young silly,&#8217; said Ruth, good-naturedly,
a reply which had no effect whatever
upon Barbara.</p>

<p>&#8216;It seems to me,&#8217; she went on thoughtfully,
&#8216;that it&#8217;s very difficult to know what is wrong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
and what isn&#8217;t, when there aren&#8217;t any punishments
and no one is there to tell you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, you&#8217;re supposed to have some sense,
you know,&#8217; explained Ruth. &#8216;Finny&#8217;s great
idea is that you should think for yourself and
not go to other people to find out things. She
says being good isn&#8217;t worth much, if you&#8217;re
only good because some one else tells you to
be good.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s all very well,&#8217; objected Babs, &#8216;but
suppose you don&#8217;t know without being told?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, if you don&#8217;t know that behaving like
a wild Indian is wrong, it&#8217;s not much good
being there to tell you so,&#8217; said Jean, bluntly.</p>

<p>The point of her remark was quite lost on
Barbara, who was still puzzling over a question
that had never occurred to her before. &#8216;At
home,&#8217; she observed, &#8216;we never talk about
whether a thing is right or wrong. If we did,
the boys would call it awfully slack.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What do they call it when you nearly kill
people by knocking them down and hitting
them?&#8217; asked Jean, rather suddenly. The
application of hot water was causing the bruise
on her forehead to smart most unpleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh!&#8217; said Barbara, in a surprised tone; &#8216;I
thought you had made it up?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bother making it up,&#8217; grumbled Jean, &#8216;when
you&#8217;ve got a lump as big as<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you say so before?&#8217; cried Babs,
in great concern. &#8216;Haven&#8217;t you any pomade
to put on it?&#8217;</p>

<p>Something very like an amused chuckle came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
from the direction of Ruth Oliver, but Babs
was in far too great a hurry to notice that.
Flinging everything right and left on the floor,
she cleared out two drawers and a box before
she succeeded in finding the bottle she wanted.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here it is!&#8217; she exclaimed, taking it in to
her wounded foe. &#8216;It&#8217;s awfully good stuff,
really; and it keeps you from turning blue and
yellow. We always use it at home.&#8217;</p>

<p>Ruth&#8217;s chuckle grew into a hearty laugh.
&#8216;I should think you wanted pounds of it
in your home, if they&#8217;re all like you!&#8217; she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Barbara wondered what the joke was.
&#8216;They&#8217;re not like me,&#8217; she said simply. &#8216;The
others are all boys, you see, so they get their
own way without fighting.&#8217;</p>

<p>And when the German governess came to
turn out their lights, she found the three white-robed
figures standing together in Jean&#8217;s room,
one of them shaking with laughter, another
trying rather unsuccessfully to keep grave,
while the third, holding out a bottle in her
hand, looked at them both with a puzzled air.
There was no end, thought Frulein, to the
caprices of English children. Had not Miss
Finlayson been relating to all the teachers
downstairs, how the two little ones before her
had flown at each other in a passion, just before
prayers?</p>

<p>The junior playroom felt equally incapable
of grappling with the situation, when the new
girl marched gaily into it the next morning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
with her arm linked in Jean Murray&#8217;s. For
once, Jean&#8217;s followers found themselves at a
loss. Not having been informed what actually
had taken place in the passage the night before,
they could hardly be expected to know all at
once how to treat this new state of affairs. Nor
did Jean trouble herself to enlighten them.
Indeed, she was so cross when any one approached
her on the subject, that even Angela
had to leave her alone; while the junior playroom
in general, being less devoted, threw out
dark hints about temper as soon as Jean was
out of hearing. Angela, however, had the wit
to see the one thing that was evident&#8211;the feud
with the new girl was at an end, and anybody
who wanted to keep friends with Jean Murray
in future would have to accept Barbara Berkeley
as well. So she decided to accept Barbara
herself, to begin with; and she set to work at
the same time to convert the whole of the
junior playroom.</p>

<p>&#8216;If you don&#8217;t behave decently to her, you&#8217;ll
have Finny down on you,&#8217; she advised, in the
few moments allowed for conversation after
breakfast. &#8216;Anybody could see that, from the
way Finny glared at Jean last night.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Did <i>you</i> see it?&#8217; inquired Charlotte Bigley,
with unpleasant directness.</p>

<p>&#8216;N&#8211;no, not exactly,&#8217; admitted Angela, uncomfortably.
&#8216;But Mary Wells did, and she
told me. And look here,&#8217; she went on, shifting
her ground hurriedly, &#8216;Jean&#8217;s made it up with
Barbara Berkeley, and the sooner we do the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
same the better it&#8217;ll be for us. Besides, why
shouldn&#8217;t we make it up? It&#8217;s such a bore to
have to keep on remembering all the time that
you&#8217;re <i>furious</i> with some one!&#8217;</p>

<p>This was more to the point; and the junior
playroom, which had never thrown itself with
any heartiness into the feud, decided that
Barbara Berkeley was to be accepted without
any more delay. Unfortunately, Barbara
Berkeley, who had never realised that her
school-fellows had been leaving her in peace on
purpose to annoy her, was quite unprepared for
the sudden change in their behaviour.</p>

<p>Charlotte Bigley was the first to put into
force the resolution that had been arrived at
by the junior playroom. &#8216;If you like,&#8217; she
observed carelessly, when she met Barbara by
the bookshelf, just before the first class, &#8216;you
can put away Ruth Oliver&#8217;s desk after preparation,
instead of me.&#8217;</p>

<p>For her part, she had always felt kindly
disposed towards the new girl, and the offer
she was making now came straight from her
heart, and was the most generous one she could
think of at the moment. But Babs only looked
dismayed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why must I put away Ruth Oliver&#8217;s desk?&#8217;
she demanded. &#8216;I have to put away Margaret
Hulme&#8217;s as it is; and it&#8217;s so difficult to get
dressed in time for supper when there&#8217;s such a
lot of desks to put away first. Of course,&#8217; she
added with an effort, &#8216;I&#8217;ll do it to please you,
if you really want me to.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>&#8216;Why, I thought you&#8217;d <i>like</i> to do it!&#8217; exclaimed
Charlotte, staring at her. &#8216;You&#8217;re so
thick with Ruth, and naturally I supposed<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Thanks awfully,&#8217; said Barbara, without enthusiasm.
&#8216;It&#8217;s really awfully kind of you, but
I think p&#8217;raps you&#8217;d better go on doing it, if
you&#8217;re used to doing it. Of course, I know
some people like doing those stupid things for
the big girls, but<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All right,&#8217; said Charlotte, abruptly; and she
went away, feeling distinctly small.</p>

<p>Babs hurried off to the Fifth classroom, and
arrived just in time for the geography lesson.
She was settling herself as usual at the bottom
desk, when her neighbour, rather a dull girl, for
whom she secretly felt a sort of contempt because
she took no interest in her lessons, but
only learned them from conscientious motives,
began making advances to her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Barbara,&#8217; she whispered, nudging the new
girl in a familiar way that was meant to be
sociable. Babs, having sat next to her for
fourteen days without extracting a single
remark from her, was considerably startled.</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you want?&#8217; she asked impatiently.
She was taking a last frantic look at the capes
of Scotland, and the interruption was agonising.</p>

<p>&#8216;Would you like to be my partner, next time
we practise running with Hurly-Burly?&#8217; proceeded
Mary Wells, with an air of extreme
benevolence. She was rather glad that Jean
Murray had made it up with the new girl, for
it had not been amusing to sit perpetually next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
to some one with whom she was not allowed to
associate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, no, of course not!&#8217; answered Barbara,
giving up the capes of Scotland in despair, and
turning rather crossly to the tiresome neighbour
who had never bothered her before. &#8216;We&#8217;re
not a bit evenly matched, and it wouldn&#8217;t be
fair. Ask Angela Wilkins, if you want a partner;
she doesn&#8217;t run <i>much</i> faster than you
do.&#8217;</p>

<p>If there had been time, her amazed neighbour
would no doubt have told her what she
thought of her. It was bad enough to have
her friendly suggestion thrown back in her
face, but to be offered a gratuitous criticism of
her running powers into the bargain was
intolerable. However, Miss Tomlinson said
&#8216;Silence!&#8217; before Mary could express her
feelings, so Babs remained in comfortable
ignorance of them.</p>

<p>She was not to be left alone for long, however,
and it soon became impossible even for
Barbara not to see that a change of some sort
had come over her school-fellows. During the
two weeks she had been at school, meal-times
had been delicious periods of peace, when every
one had babbled round her but never to her,
and nobody had interrupted her if she wanted
to dream. But to-day, when they all met in
the dining-room for lunch, in the ten minutes&#8217;
&#8216;break&#8217; that occurred in the middle of the
morning, it was evident that her time for dreaming
was gone by. This was the opportunity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
that the children of the junior playroom had
been eagerly awaiting since the moment when
Angela had succeeded in moving them to
charitable designs. So Babs had scarcely made
her appearance in the dining-room, than a
crowd of eager penitents descended upon her,
jostling one another in the attempt to be first.
One rushed at her with the biscuits, another
with a glass of milk, and a third with a plateful
of bread and jam.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, don&#8217;t bother! Thanks awfully, don&#8217;t
you know,&#8217; stammered Barbara, who was a little
flustered at finding herself the object of so
much attention. She helped herself to bread
and jam, accepted the milk, which the bearer
insisted on holding for her till she felt inclined
to drink it, and then tried to slip away as usual
to a retired corner. But her way was barred
by another group of girls, headed by the zealous
Angela herself.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wonder if you&#8217;ll help me with my algebra
in French class,&#8217; began the latter, beaming
upon her former enemy with the air of one who
was conferring a favour. &#8216;I always get in such
a bog over it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re so splendid at algebra, Babs, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8217; added another, with great warmth.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s good at lots of things! She&#8217;ll get to
the top of the Fifth in no time, won&#8217;t she?&#8217;
cried Angela, with her ordinary disregard for
facts.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, no,&#8217; said Barbara, earnestly. &#8216;There&#8217;s
my spelling; you&#8217;re forgetting that.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>&#8216;Ye&#8211;es,&#8217; allowed Angela, unwillingly; &#8216;but
spelling isn&#8217;t everything.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Should think not, indeed!&#8217; echoed the
chorus of enthusiasts.</p>

<p>&#8216;And I don&#8217;t know any arithmetic,&#8217; proceeded
Barbara, desperately. It really hurt her regard
for truth to have all these absurd remarks made
about her.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s arithmetic?&#8217; demanded Angela,
loudly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Only think of the piles of history you know!&#8217;
chimed in some one else.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, indeed!&#8217; said the chorus.</p>

<p>&#8216;And Latin!&#8217; proclaimed another admirer.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8211;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8217; murmured Babs,
unhappily.</p>

<p>She could not think what had come over
them all; and they made her feel foolish.
Fortunately, somebody noticed just then that
she had finished the bread and jam; and they
all rushed off, jostling one another again as
they went, to find fresh provisions. Barbara
seized the opportunity to escape, dodged the
placid bearer of the milk, and went in search of
Jean Murray. She had an uncommonly shrewd
suspicion that Jean Murray was somehow at
the bottom of this new and irritating persecution.</p>

<p>She found her hidden away in a corner of
the big dining-room, occupying very much the
position that Barbara herself had enjoyed until
now. Her appearance was dejected, and she
looked as though the encouragement of noble
sentiments did not agree with her nearly so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
well as the strife and wrangling in which she
usually indulged. The truth was that her new
pose of friendliness was making her feel unpleasantly
self-conscious; and she was afraid of
being laughed at by the big girls for having so
meekly accepted her late enemy for a friend.
The big girls, of course, worried themselves so
little about the petty quarrels of the junior
playroom, that they had no more intention of
laughing at her than Barbara had; but it was
impossible for so important a person as Jean
Murray to realise that. So she gave a guilty
start when Barbara, heated, aggrieved, and
bubbling over with resentment, suddenly
pounced upon her in her corner.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, look here,&#8217; began Babs, impetuously;
&#8216;I thought you&#8217;d made it up, and it&#8217;s a shame!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What are you talking about?&#8217; demanded
Jean Murray. &#8216;I have made it up, long ago.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then whose fault is it that all those girls
keep bothering me?&#8217; exclaimed Barbara, growing
more indignant as she went on. &#8216;I haven&#8217;t
had a moment&#8217;s peace all the morning, and it
makes me feel silly. I don&#8217;t like being made
to feel silly. Why don&#8217;t you tell them to leave
me alone?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking
about,&#8217; said Jean. &#8216;How are they making you
feel silly?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They keep on telling me how clever I am,&#8217;
grumbled Barbara, in a tone of the deepest
contempt. &#8216;Me clever! Just think of it!
And they say I&#8217;m going to get to the top of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
the class, and all that rot. What do they
mean by it? That&#8217;s what I want to know. I
was just beginning to get used to girls, and I
told Kit only yesterday that they were not so
bad after all, because they left you pretty much
to yourself; and now&#8211;look at them! It&#8217;s
enough to make any one feel silly. Well,
what&#8217;s the joke?&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean was laughing heartily. It was the first
time that morning she had been able to forget
her own feelings of &#8216;silliness&#8217;; and it cheered
her considerably to find that some one else was
in the same plight as herself. &#8216;You <i>are</i> queer!&#8217;
she declared. &#8216;Why, they are doing all that
to show that they want to be nice to you, of
course.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara stared at her aghast. &#8216;Oh!&#8217; was all
she said at first. After a pause for reflection,
she added suddenly, &#8216;Then what were they
trying to be all the time they left me alone?&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean stopped laughing, and began kicking
at the window-seat by which they stood.</p>

<p>&#8216;Was that their way of being nasty?&#8217; proceeded
Babs, in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8211;I suppose so,&#8217; muttered Jean, looking
away from her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh!&#8217; said Barbara again.</p>

<p>There was another pause, and then Jean
made an immense effort. &#8216;I made them leave
you alone,&#8217; she jerked out. &#8216;I hated you. It&#8211;it
was because of Margaret Hulme.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara&#8217;s puzzled look vanished. When she
did begin to understand a thing, she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
generally pretty quick about it. &#8216;I&#8217;m beastly sorry,&#8217;
she said softly. &#8216;A little while ago, I thought
Jill was going to make the boys like her better
than me; and I felt just like that. What a
pity you didn&#8217;t tell me sooner!&#8217;</p>

<p>That, after all, was their real reconciliation;
and this time there was no doubt about it. If
there had been, it would have been ended
finally by Margaret Hulme herself, that same
afternoon, in the cloakroom. The head girl
had been taking off her own muddy boots for
more than a fortnight now; and that in itself
was enough to quicken her observation of
events in the junior playroom.</p>

<p>&#8216;Isn&#8217;t there anybody over there who would
like to unlace my boots for me?&#8217; she said in a
loud voice, as the younger ones came trooping
into the cloakroom after the hockey practice.</p>

<p>There was silence in the ranks of the juniors.
The big girls were smiling, the little ones
looked at one another doubtfully, and the
head girl waited with her foot put forward.
The etiquette of the junior playroom was
tremendous, and although forty-five sets of
fingers were itching to be at the knot in the
head girl&#8217;s bootlace, nobody could move until
Jean Murray did.</p>

<p>&#8216;You can do it, if you like,&#8217; she said to
Barbara indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, no,&#8217; said Barbara, quickly. &#8216;I shouldn&#8217;t
think of it.&#8217; This time, her sacrifice was
genuine, for Margaret had kissed her just
before dinner and told her she was a &#8216;good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
little soul,&#8217; and the feeling of the youngest girl
in the school had considerably changed in consequence
with regard to the head girl&#8217;s boots.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course,&#8217; said Margaret Hulme, drawing
back her foot, &#8216;if nobody <i>wants</i><span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>A murmur ran along the ranks of the juniors,
and Babs suddenly whispered something in
Jean&#8217;s ear. Then the two children joined
hands and presented themselves solemnly
before the head girl.</p>

<p>&#8216;Please,&#8217; said Barbara, quickly, &#8216;we&#8217;ve settled
it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s about time,&#8217; observed Margaret.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re going to halve it,&#8217; added Jean, in a
great hurry.</p>

<p>&#8216;What? My foot?&#8217; asked the head girl.</p>

<p>The wit of the head girl produced a storm of
laughter in the cloakroom. When it subsided,
Barbara was ready with her explanation.</p>

<p>&#8216;Jean&#8217;s going to do them four days, and I&#8217;m
going to do them the other three,&#8217; she said.
&#8216;And Jean&#8217;s going to begin,&#8217; she added, and
walked away heroically.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, no, you begin,&#8217; said Jean, feebly.</p>

<p>But Margaret smiled and pinched her ear.
&#8216;You begin, child,&#8217; she said; and Jean fairly

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>MISS FINLAYSON&#8217;S UNCLE, THE CANON</span></h2>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s all very well to tell you to do things for
other people; but when nobody wants anything
done, how are you going to carry it out?&#8217;
demanded Charlotte Bigley of a circle of
attentive listeners.</p>

<p>It was plain-work evening, some five weeks
or so before the end of the term; and fifty-five
busy little people, on one side of the curtain,
sewed laboriously at fifty-five flannel garments,
while thirty-two others, in the seniors&#8217; room,
were cutting out fresh ones and struggling with
what Miss Smythe called the &#8216;fixing.&#8217; Usually,
plain-work evening was the dullest out of the
seven, for conversation did not flourish under
the depressing dominion of flannel, and Miss
Smythe, the needlework mistress who came
from the town twice a week to teach them, had
never managed to interest her pupils either in
herself or in what they were doing. But to-night
there was something to discuss that
thrilled every one of the workers on both sides
of the curtain, and the effect on the flannel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
garments of this unusual enthusiasm even
awoke a faint wonderment in the mind of Miss
Smythe. She did not know, never having
tried to win the confidence of the children, that
the cause of the emotion that was pulsing from
end to end of the two playrooms was the
temporary residence, under the honoured roof
of Wootton Beeches, of Miss Finlayson&#8217;s uncle,
the Canon.</p>

<p>The Canon had always been an object of
interest, theoretically, to the girls at Wootton
Beeches. They did not know much about him,
except that he lived in some cathedral town in
the North of England, and came South about
once a year and spent part of his holiday at
Wootton Beeches; and they were familiar with
his portrait, which always stood on the writing-table
in his niece&#8217;s study. That was all they
could have told anybody; but the very lack of
facts only added to the magic of his name, and as
none of them happened to be in touch with a
bishop, or even with a dean, Miss Finlayson&#8217;s
uncle the Canon continued to impress them
from a distance with his importance. Hitherto,
his visit had always happened to fall in the
holidays; but, this time, he had unaccountably
appeared in the middle of the term, and the
excitement of his actual presence among them
had given them enough news to put in their
letters home for quite two weeks. The day
before, he had even replaced the curate in the
little chapel, and had not only read prayers but
had delivered an address on unselfishness as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
well; and it was this address that had provided
the whole school, on plain-work evening, with
a burning topic of conversation.</p>

<p>The problem that had just been put into
words by Charlotte Bigley was one that had
exercised the ingenuity of everybody since
yesterday morning. To do good works was
the present ardent desire of all their hearts;
but where were the good works to be found?</p>

<p>&#8216;I suppose there&#8217;s always something to be
done for somebody, only we&#8217;ve got to discover
what it is,&#8217; said Mary Wells, after profound
reflection.</p>

<p>&#8216;He did say life was full of little things that
were waiting to be done, but it&#8217;s so easy to talk
like that,&#8217; complained Jean Murray. &#8216;Why
didn&#8217;t he say <i>what</i> things?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, you see, we&#8217;ve got to discover what
they are,&#8217; persisted Mary. When she did
manage to produce an idea, she was always
very slow to part with it.</p>

<p>&#8216;You said that before,&#8217; retorted Jean, impolitely;
&#8216;and it doesn&#8217;t help anybody at all.
You can&#8217;t go round <i>asking</i> people, can you?
They&#8217;d call you a nuisance.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara sighed, and laid down the blackened
piece of flannel she had been toiling at since
the beginning of term. Between the address
of the Canon and the shapelessness of her
flannel petticoat, life was very difficult to
understand just then.</p>

<p>&#8216;Besides,&#8217; she chimed in, when Jean finished
speaking, &#8216;if everybody is doing something for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
everybody else, there&#8217;s nobody left to do anything
for!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Finny always says we are to do things for
ourselves as much as we can, and that the way
to help other people most is to see that they
don&#8217;t have to bother about <i>us</i>. That&#8217;s not a
bit the same thing as going round and finding
out what people want done for them,&#8217; continued
Charlotte, eloquently.</p>

<p>&#8216;They can&#8217;t both be right,&#8217; declared Angela,
shrilly. &#8216;If the Canon says one thing and
Finny says another, what are we to believe,
and what is the truth of it all, I should
like to know? The <i>truth</i>&#8211;that&#8217;s what <i>I</i>
want!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, you do,&#8217; remarked Babs, beginning to
chuckle. &#8216;You want it awfully badly, most of
the time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You mind your own business, Barbara
Berkeley, and I&#8217;ll mind mine,&#8217; advised Angela,
threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8216;But that&#8217;s just what we haven&#8217;t got to do,&#8217;
retorted Babs, with another laugh. &#8216;I&#8217;ve got
to forget my own business and look after
somebody else&#8217;s, and so have you. The
Canon said so.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The Canon never said anybody was to
have enough cheek for two people, anyhow,&#8217;
returned Angela, rather feebly. She generally
ended in coming off the worse in a battle
of words with Barbara. On this occasion,
however, she had the junior playroom with
her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>&#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t joke about serious things,
Barbara Berkeley,&#8217; said Mary Wells, disapprovingly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Barbara Berkeley thinks she can laugh at
everything!&#8217; cried Angela, with renewed
courage.</p>

<p>Miss Smythe came up at the same moment
and put the crowning touch on Barbara&#8217;s discomfiture
by examining the luckless flannel
petticoat and disclosing the fact that she had
sewed it up all the way round.</p>

<p>&#8216;How do you expect a child is going to get
into that?&#8217; asked the needlework mistress,
holding up the misshapen garment to the
derision of the whole room.</p>

<p>Barbara accepted the criticism and the
laughter with equal unconcern. She had never
supposed that any child was going to get into
a petticoat that only existed for her express
torture and the witticisms of Miss Smythe. It
had been unpicked so often that it would
scarcely hold the large, uneven stitches she
repeatedly put into it; and she took up the
scissors and began to undo it all over again as
a necessary part of the evening&#8217;s proceedings.
Hardly, however, had she snipped at the first
piece of cotton, than she was assailed on both
sides by eager helpers, thirsting for the painful
pleasures of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let me do it for you, Babe!&#8217; exclaimed
Angela, quite forgetting their recent dispute
on the very subject of the virtue she now was
so anxious to exploit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>&#8216;No, let me,&#8217; begged Mary Wells on the
other side.</p>

<p>Barbara looked from one to the other doubtfully.
The Canon had said nothing about
complications of this kind. Then Mary took
the decision and the flannel petticoat simultaneously
out of her hands.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do, there&#8217;s a dear,&#8217; she said coaxingly.
&#8216;Think how I helped you with your German
the day before yesterday.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a shame,&#8217; vowed Angela Wilkins, retiring
sulkily. &#8216;I did ask first!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Never mind,&#8217; said Babs, soothingly; &#8216;I&#8217;m
sure to do it again before long; I always do.&#8217;</p>

<p>Angela, however, found a more abiding consolation
in Barbara&#8217;s temporary idleness.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re not doing anything for anybody,
that&#8217;s certain!&#8217; she threw back at her jeeringly.
&#8216;Why, you&#8217;re the only idle person in the room!
Call that being unselfish, indeed!&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara hastened to clear herself of the
reproach by picking up Mary Wells&#8217;s neatly
made and spotless piece of white flannel. She
was not sure what it was meant for, as it was
not sewed together anywhere; and she had
never been shown how to do the elaborate
scallops that ornamented the edge of it. But
a trifle like want of skill made very little difference
to a seeker after self-sacrifice; and Babs
recklessly plunged her needle into the beginning
of the next scallop, and entangled the silk
hopelessly. A cry from Mary Wells disturbed
her well-meant efforts. The Canon, thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
Mary, might say what he liked about people
doing things for others, but was it quite fair
when they did them all wrong?</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s for my sister&#8217;s baby,&#8217; she lamented,
seizing her handiwork from the zealous Barbara;
&#8216;and if I don&#8217;t finish it soon, the baby
will be too big for head-flannels at all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But&#8211;I wanted to do something for you,&#8217;
protested Babs, in a disappointed tone.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ve stickied the needle, and left a great
black finger-mark on it,&#8217; wailed Mary Wells,
making fresh discoveries, as she went on, of
what Babs <i>had</i> done for her.</p>

<p>Miss Smythe came up to know what the
fuss was about; and she promptly added her
word to the condemnation of Barbara Berkeley.</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you mean by touching anybody
else&#8217;s work, you naughty little girl?&#8217; she said
sharply. &#8216;You are more trouble than anybody
else in the school, and you ought to be ashamed
of yourself.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara did not look at all ashamed of herself.
She never did when people were cross
with her. Mary Wells had the grace to come
to her assistance.</p>

<p>&#8216;Please, Miss Smythe,&#8217; she said, swallowing
her mortification at the ravages in the head-flannel,
&#8216;it was my fault as well. I took
Barbara&#8217;s work, to begin with.&#8217;</p>

<p>The needlework mistress stared from one to
the other. &#8216;What&#8217;s come over the children?&#8217;
she exclaimed. &#8216;Why are you interfering with
each other&#8217;s work like this?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>Barbara assumed an exaggerated expression
of meekness. &#8216;Please, it was because we were
both trying to sacrifice ourselves,&#8217; she announced.</p>

<p>It certainly sounded a ridiculous reason
when it was put that way, but it completed the
perplexity of Miss Smythe, and that was something.</p>

<p>&#8216;It seems to me,&#8217; she said severely, &#8216;that
you are strangely forgetting yourself, Barbara
Berkeley. Commence what I gave you to do
at once, and stand up until I tell you to sit
down again.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, the Canon <i>said</i> we were to forget
ourselves,&#8217; began Babs, mischievously; and
there is no doubt that a further penalty would
have been added to her punishment had not
Jean Murray made a sudden diversion by
dropping her thimble. In spite of the want
of success that had attended Barbara&#8217;s attempt
at good works, the influence of the Canon was
still very strong among the occupants of the
junior playroom; and five girls hastily flung
aside their work, and bumped their heads
together on the floor in their hurry to restore
Jean her property. Jean took it with the
grudging manner of one who would like to
have been in the fortunate position of conferring
rather than of accepting a service; and
Miss Smythe in despair condemned five more
culprits to a standing position.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the Canon expressed
a wish that evening to see what the young
people were doing with themselves; and it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
happened that Miss Finlayson brought him
through the curtain into the junior playroom
just after the six ringleaders had been ordered
to stand up.</p>

<p>&#8216;Very nice, very charming, to be sure!&#8217;
murmured the old gentleman, whose benevolent
face had gone a long way in carrying his address
home to the hearts of his hearers. &#8216;Such
a beautiful and womanly sight, too! I suppose
you are all working for the poor, eh, my dears?
Very excellent indeed, I&#8217;m sure!&#8217;</p>

<p>His niece was busy talking with Miss
Smythe, and did not correct his mistake; and
the children were too shy to do more than look
at one another and giggle faintly. The Canon
went on, and bent over Mary Wells, who appealed
to him at once by the serious expression
of her face and her diligent application to the
head-flannel.</p>

<p>&#8216;And for whom are you working so industriously,
may I ask?&#8217; he inquired benignly.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s for my sister&#8211;I mean the baby,&#8217;
stammered Mary, much flustered at being thus
singled out. The Canon felt a little perplexed,
not having supposed Mary Wells or her sister
to belong to what he largely called &#8216;the poor&#8217;;
and he passed on hurriedly to where the six
culprits stood first on one leg and then on
the other, trying to stitch at their work with
wavering and unsteadied fingers.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i5'></a><img src='images/illus-175.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8216;Dear me!&#8217; he said, slightly taken aback.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>&#8216;Dear me!&#8217; he said, slightly taken aback.
&#8216;Is it&#8211;is it quite usual&#8211;I mean, do you find
it <i>convenient</i> to perform your&#8211;your embroidery
in that exceedingly arduous position?&#8217;</p>

<p>The six girls edged up to one another; and
more giggles, very nervous ones this time,
greeted the Canon&#8217;s remark. He put on his
eye-glasses, and began slowly to grasp the
meaning of their uncomfortable position.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; he said, with a knowing smile. &#8216;So
you have done something you shouldn&#8217;t, eh,
my dears? Shocking, shocking! Let us see
what the cause of offence is, and perhaps we
can get the punishment mitigated for you.
How would that be, eh?&#8217;</p>

<p>He turned to look for Miss Smythe, and
the six put their heads together for a hasty,
whispered consultation.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let&#8217;s tell him it&#8217;s through his sermon,&#8217;
urged Barbara, all agog with mischief. &#8216;It
would be such fun!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly not!&#8217; decided Angela, solemnly.
&#8216;He must never know. Didn&#8217;t he say it was
splendid to suffer for righteousness&#8217;s sake, and
isn&#8217;t this <i>real</i> righteousness?&#8217;</p>

<p>She carried the remaining four with her;
and by the time Finny and Miss Smythe joined
the Canon in front of them, five out of the six
faces glowed with the fervour of martyrdom.
The sixth was glowing too, but hardly from
such a lofty motive.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said Miss Finlayson, gently, &#8216;and
what is the reason of this?&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Smythe coughed and hesitated. She
did not understand her pupils in the least, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
she had a certain feeling of loyalty towards
them, and she did not want to get them into
trouble. Added to this, she really did not
know the reason of it.</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8211;they were a little tiresome, and I
made them stand up,&#8217; she explained hurriedly.
&#8216;No doubt&#8211;only high spirits, and&#8211;and so on.
I&#8211;I could not quite grasp what had been upsetting
them this evening, and I always find
standing up is&#8211;is an excellent remedy for&#8211;for
high spirits, in short.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was the opinion of the junior playroom
afterwards that &#8216;Smithy&#8217; had got out of it
very well; and she went up in its estimation
henceforth. But her explanation failed to
satisfy Miss Finlayson. There was something
about the virtuousness on the offenders&#8217; faces
that struck her as being overdone; and she
turned to the one at the end of the row, whose
countenance was a study in suppressed emotions,
and tried to get at the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>&#8216;What was it, Barbara?&#8217; she asked in that
tone of hers that would make any girl tell her
anything. Not that Barbara, on this occasion,
needed forcing.</p>

<p>&#8216;It was because of the sermon yesterday,&#8217;
she said, bubbling over with enjoyment of the
situation. &#8216;And we were all trying to sacrifice
ourselves, and it was so difficult, because nobody
wanted anything done; and then Mary
Wells sacrificed herself for me, so I tried to
do the same for her, and I only spoiled the
baby&#8217;s head-flannel, and made Smithy&#8211;I mean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
Miss Smythe&#8211;wild. That was why I stood up.
The other five stood up because they all tried to
sacrifice themselves for Jean&#8217;s thimble; and
Miss Smythe hadn&#8217;t heard the sermon, you see,
and she only thought they were being naughty,
so<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That will do,&#8217; said Miss Finlayson, and
she turned her back hurriedly on the row of
martyrs. The needlework mistress was almost
in tears at what she considered a wilfully
frivolous manner of referring to a sermon by a
real canon. But the Canon just passed his
hand across his mouth, and then gave up the
attempt to look shocked.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are very good little girls to listen so
attentively to people&#8217;s sermons,&#8217; he said, smiling
openly. &#8216;And I think, if anybody ought to
stand up, it should be by rights a certain old
gentleman who preaches them. What do you
say, Miss Smythe? If I promise to stand up
for the rest of the evening, will you let these
six young ladies sit down?&#8217;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FURTHER PURSUIT OF GOOD WORKS</span></h2>

<p>&#8216;All the same,&#8217; said Jean Murray afterwards,
&#8216;it doesn&#8217;t mean that the Canon&#8217;s sermon was
wrong just because all of you were so stupid in
the way you tried to make it work.&#8217;</p>

<p>She could not really resist such an enticing
opportunity of showing her superiority; but
her less fortunate school-fellows found it difficult
to appreciate her point of view, and they
resented it accordingly.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s only just by chance that it wasn&#8217;t you
as well,&#8217; Barbara hastened to point out.</p>

<p>&#8216;And you know you began by being jealous
because <i>we</i> were doing all the sacrificing,&#8217;
added Angela.</p>

<p>The others, not being in the inner circle of
Jean&#8217;s friendship, did not venture on an open
remonstrance; but one of them asked her
bluntly what she considered the Canon did
mean by his address.</p>

<p>Jean drew herself up complacently. &#8216;Well,
of course he meant much bigger things than
just picking up people&#8217;s thimbles and interfering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
with everybody all round,&#8217; she began rather
contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8216;He said <i>little</i> things, all the same,&#8217; observed
Mary Wells, doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8216;That,&#8217; said Jean, airily, &#8216;was only his way
of putting it&#8211;and because he was a canon,&#8217; she
added, struck by a brilliant thought. &#8216;When
you are a canon, the things you consider little
are the same as the things that ordinary people
call big.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bravo, Jean,&#8217; said Charlotte Bigley, sarcastically.
&#8216;Now, let us hear what the big
things are.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean was on her mettle, and she gave herself
a moment&#8217;s desperate reflection.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, things like helping the poor, and taking
food to people who are starving, and giving up
your pocket-money to buy things for them, and
not minding how dirty they are, nor how wicked
and dishonest and&#8211;and tipsy,&#8217; she proclaimed.</p>

<p>The junior playroom was much impressed
by this new view of the Canon&#8217;s sermon.</p>

<p>&#8216;Isn&#8217;t Jean clever?&#8217; demanded Angela,
proudly, of her immediate neighbours. One of
these happened to be Barbara, who fully agreed
with her, but still appeared a little puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8216;It will be very difficult to do all that,&#8217; she
observed. &#8216;How can we do things for the
poor, when we never see any poor?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You never know when the chance may
come,&#8217; answered Jean, who was rarely at a loss.
&#8216;Besides, there&#8217;s the holidays.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What!&#8217; said Mary, in a voice of dismay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
&#8216;Have we got to wait till the <i>holidays</i> before
we can be unselfish?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; replied Jean, vaguely, &#8216;you can&#8217;t say
that, for an opportunity may occur at any
minute. What we&#8217;ve got to do is to be on the
look-out for it.&#8217;</p>

<p>This unsatisfactory way of disposing of the
Canon&#8217;s address fell very flat after the recent
excitement in the juniors&#8217; room concerning it;
and most of Jean&#8217;s listeners grumbled loudly as
soon as she was out of hearing. But Babs and
Angela unhesitatingly threw in their lot with
Jean. They were not quite sure what she
meant, but they never doubted her right to be
their leader in this as in everything.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll all keep on the look-out,&#8217; they said
to one another; &#8216;and the first who sees an
opportunity of helping the poor must promise
to share it with the other two.&#8217;</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon came round in another
day or two, and on Saturday afternoon the girls
could do pretty much as they liked, as soon as the
hockey practice was over. It was one of those
late wintry days in March which bring with
them a promise of spring to come: there was a
sharpness in the air, now that the sun was nearing
the west, that proclaimed it still to be
winter, while a faint earthiness of smell, a
tumult of birds&#8217; voices in the hedge, and an
intense blueness above, all told of the warmer
season in store. The triumvirate, as Margaret
Hulme had nicknamed Jean and her two inseparable
companions, were much too fond of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
the open air to go indoors before they were
obliged; so, while most of their school-fellows
voted for the fire and a story-book, they wandered
off down the nine-acre field, their arms
linked affectionately together. Their conversation
was very engrossing, for it turned on the
gymnastic competition that was going to be
held at the end of the term, for which the
Canon had just offered a prize of six morocco-bound
books, to be chosen by the successful
competitor herself.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s where this hole is such a nice hole
for a school,&#8217; said Jean. &#8216;At the other school
I went to, they never asked you what books
you&#8217;d like; and they always gave you <i>poetry</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Some poetry is all right. I think I like
poetry when it&#8217;s got a story in it, and the
rhymes are not too far away from one another,
and the lines jog along without your having to
bother about them,&#8217; remarked Babs.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, that kind isn&#8217;t bad,&#8217; admitted Jean.
&#8216;I didn&#8217;t mean Macaulay and Longfellow and
all the <i>real</i> poets. But the stuff they gave you
at my school was horribly dull, and it never
had any sort of story in it, and the lines didn&#8217;t
seem to belong to one another at all; and there
was generally a thing called a glossary at the
end, which only showed that it wasn&#8217;t fit for
any one to read.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I know that kind of poetry; we have lots
of it at home,&#8217; put in Angela. &#8216;There&#8217;s a chap
called Browning who&#8217;s rather like that. Have
you ever read any Browning, you two?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>&#8216;No,&#8217; said Jean, flatly. &#8216;Don&#8217;t believe you
have either. My father says Browning didn&#8217;t
understand himself, and I&#8217;m sure <i>you</i> don&#8217;t know
more than Browning. So there!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Never mind about the poetry,&#8217; interposed
Barbara. &#8216;I want to hear about the gym prize.
Who do you think is going to get it, Jean?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, Margaret is awfully good, of course,
but we shall know better after the trial on
Monday afternoon,&#8217; said Jean, cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8216;What trial?&#8217; asked Barbara.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; exclaimed Jean, in surprise, &#8216;didn&#8217;t
you hear Finny give out that we were all to do
the show exercises before her on Monday
afternoon, so that she could decide who was to
go in for the prize?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course she didn&#8217;t hear; the Babe&#8217;s
always asleep!&#8217; said Angela, with scorn. &#8216;I
watched her all the time Finny was speaking,
and she was smiling away to herself as if some
one was having a conversation with her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Never mind, she&#8217;s getting better,&#8217; said Jean,
approvingly. &#8216;She doesn&#8217;t gape half so much
as she did, and she doesn&#8217;t jump when you go
up and speak to her suddenly. By the way,
you&#8217;ve got as good a chance as any one, Babe,
of getting the gym prize.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara, who had taken their frank criticisms
of her without a murmur, could not allow this
last assertion to pass. She pulled up suddenly
in the middle of the field, and looked first at
one and then at the other of her two companions.
&#8216;What do you mean?&#8217; she gasped.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i6'></a><img src='images/illus-183.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8216;Hullo! said Jean. What&#8217;s the matter?&#8217;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>&#8216;Oh, you&#8217;re putting it on; don&#8217;t be affected,&#8217;
scoffed Angela.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, she isn&#8217;t putting it on; she never does,&#8217;
objected Jean. &#8216;Look at home, Angela, before
you talk about affectation.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All the same,&#8217; continued Angela, undisturbed,
&#8216;you must know you&#8217;re perfectly
splendid at gym, Babs. Now, don&#8217;t you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d quite forgotten,&#8217; confessed Barbara, as
they resumed their stroll. &#8216;I&#8217;m so bad at
most things that I&#8217;d got out of the way of thinking
I could do gymnastics. But, of course, the
boys always said I wasn&#8217;t bad, for a girl; and
once I got the prize at my class in London.
There were only thirty of us, though,&#8217; she
added modestly.</p>

<p>They strolled on as far as the gate at the
bottom of the field, and stood looking over it
into the lane below. The lane was out of
bounds, which lent it an added charm; and
they liked nothing better than to come here on
half-holidays and lean against the gate, and
wonder where the grass-grown path led to and
what it looked like when it got round the
corner by the old elm tree. To-day, they had
scarcely taken up their position there when they
were startled by sounds of distress from below;
and the next minute a small boy came slouching
along the lane, crying bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hullo!&#8217; said Jean. &#8216;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8217;</p>

<p>The boy was so surprised that he stopped
crying and looked up. He was a very pitiable
little object, in corduroy garments that could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
not properly be called knickerbockers and yet
were too short for trousers, with a small area of
grey flannel shirt appearing above them, and a
red worsted comforter twisted round his neck,
making an unbecoming patch of colour against
his pinched and tear-stained little face.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is the matter?&#8217; asked Angela, pityingly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you hurt yourself?&#8217; added Barbara,
as the child only stared at them vacantly.</p>

<p>With a little more coaxing and the bribe of
a piece of dusty chocolate that came from the
depths of Barbara&#8217;s pocket, he was at last
induced to mumble out a confused statement of
his woes. Between the quaver in his voice and
the broadness of his speech they had a hard
matter to understand what he said; but Angela,
who lived in another part of the same county,
managed after a while to translate to the others
that he was crying because his father was away
looking for work, and his mother could not pay
the rent, and they were all going into the
&#8216;house&#8217; to-morrow. To Bobby Hearne, who
was smarting under the remarks of the neighbours&#8217;
children, it was the last part of his story
that seemed the worst; but the triumvirate
only grasped the fact that starvation and
poverty really stood before them in the person
of the small boy with the red comforter round
his neck. They looked at one another breathlessly,
for the same thought was in all their
minds.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s the opportunity!&#8217; said Jean, solemnly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>&#8216;They&#8217;re really starving!&#8217; cried Barbara,
clapping her hands joyfully. &#8216;We must go
and feed them<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And give them clothes,&#8217; added Angela,
enthusiastically; &#8216;and pocket-money!&#8217;</p>

<p>Babs pulled a purse out of her pocket.
&#8216;Here&#8217;s three and sevenpence halfpenny, and
I&#8217;ve got ten shillings more in my left-hand
corner drawer,&#8217; she said earnestly. &#8216;Will that
be enough, do you think?&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean had been thinking deeply. &#8216;It&#8217;s no use
giving anything to that scrap of a child,&#8217; she
decided. &#8216;We must go and see his mother
first, and find out if his story is true. My
father says that indis-indiscrim-in-<i>ate</i> charity
does an awful lot of harm. We don&#8217;t want to
do indiscrimin-<i>ate</i> charity, do we? Come along,
you two, and look sharp!&#8217;</p>

<p>They clambered over the gate and dropped
into the lane, one by one. Barbara was the
last, and she almost forgot the solemn reason
for their expedition in the thrilling thought that
they were going to find out at last where the
lane went to. She was quite unprepared for
the disappointment she felt when they turned
the corner by the old elm tree and the forbidden
world beyond burst upon their view. After
all, the lane was just the same round the corner,
except that it was not quite so interesting, for
it grew less grassy as it went on, and finally
widened out into a kind of cart-track that was
anything but romantic. An enchanted princess
might flee with a prince down a grass-grown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
lane that wound away to nowhere in particular
but she would never dream of stumbling over
sharp flint stones and splashing through puddles
in a common cart-track. The other two did
not seem to notice that there was anything
wrong with the lane, though; they just kept on
straight ahead, with Bobby Hearne shuffling
along between them, and Barbara had to run a
little to catch them up.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it far?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oop agin the top end o&#8217; the village,&#8217;
explained Bobby, who was fast losing his shyness
under the influence of these wonderful
young ladies, who carried such funny sticks in
their hands, and talked in such a magnificent
way about pocket-money.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s close to the church, on the way up
from the station,&#8217; said Jean. &#8216;Is yours the
cottage with the red roof, Bobby, or the one
with roses all over it?&#8217;</p>

<p>Bobby looked vacant again; he did not
recognise his home from Jean&#8217;s picturesque
description. &#8216;There be foive pig-styes along
of it,&#8217; he announced, after long and careful
reflection.</p>

<p>The cart-track brought them to a ploughed
field, across which they plodded laboriously,
and in the end it landed them in the road that
ran right through the village. They met a
good many inquisitive glances as they hastened
along, for the young ladies of Wootton Beeches
very rarely left their own grounds, and certainly
never appeared in the village except on their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
way to and from the station. They found their
courage slowly evaporating in the face of the
curiosity they provoked, and there was very
little of it left by the time they arrived at the
cottage with the five pig-styes. Talking about
good works in the junior playroom was a very
different matter, they found, from carrying them
out in a strange cottage, where numbers of
strange children came out from dark corners
and gaped at them without saying a word of
welcome. Babs and Angela pushed forward
their leader, and peered over her shoulder as
she stood hesitating on the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hello, mother!&#8217; shouted Bobby, hustling
his brothers and sisters out of the way and
penetrating into the gloomy recesses of the
cottage. &#8216;Here be three yoong ladies come to
see ye.&#8217;</p>

<p>A harassed-looking woman came in from the
back-yard, and started when she saw the three
faces in the doorway. &#8216;It be proper good of
ye, for sure,&#8217; she said, casting nervous glances
from her unexpected visitors to a bed that was
made up on the floor, near the empty grate;
&#8216;but my girl Lilian Eliza, she be ill, she be,
and ye&#8217;d best not come in, I reckon.&#8217;</p>

<p>She did not know the power of the Canon&#8217;s
address. At the sound of her voice, the triumvirate,
neither understanding nor heeding her
warning, stepped firmly into the room.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m so sorry your daughter is ill,&#8217; began
Barbara, fumbling hastily in her pocket.
&#8216;Would three and sevenpence halfpenny be any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
good, do you think? And I&#8217;ve got ten shillings
more in my<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean nudged her violently, but the woman&#8217;s
eyes had glistened at the mention of money,
and Babs emptied her purse impetuously on the
table.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bless ye, missy, for sure!&#8217; said the woman,
gratefully. &#8216;Lilian Eliza, she be goin&#8217; to the
infirmary to-morrow, she be, and I can git her
Neighbour Bunce&#8217;s spring-cart wi&#8217; that, I can.&#8217;</p>

<p>Her evident gratitude reproached Jean, and
she forgot all about the dangers of indiscriminate
charity. She took the other two by the hand
and pulled them away to the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll come back again directly, Mrs.
Hearne,&#8217; she called out. Then the triumvirate
broke into a run, and vanished along the road
before the eyes of the bewildered woman.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are we going to do?&#8217; asked Angela,
panting, when they once more climbed the gate
at the bottom of the nine-acre field.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re going straight to the larder, straight
as we can go; and then, we&#8217;re just going to
bag all the food we can carry,&#8217; answered Jean,
in an odd, determined sort of tone. &#8216;Did you
see the look on that woman&#8217;s face when you
gave her the money, Babe? I believe&#8211;I
believe they&#8217;ve all had nothing to eat for <i>weeks</i>!
It&#8217;s&#8211;it&#8217;s horrible to think of!&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a sob in her voice, and the other
two were silent from sympathy and a kind of
awkwardness. They had never heard Jean
talk like this before, and it finished the work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
begun by the Canon&#8217;s address. There was not
the thought of a scruple in either of their minds
when they arrived at the back of the house, and
Jean bade them climb up by the water-butt and
get into the larder through the open window.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s sure to be a hook you can undo so
as to move the wire netting aside,&#8217; she told
them. &#8216;If we went round to the door, some
one might make a fuss; and there&#8217;s no time for
fusses.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Jean knows everything,&#8217; murmured Angela,
as she found the hook and squeezed successfully
through the window.</p>

<p>&#8216;What shall we take?&#8217; whispered Babs,
slipping after her into the dimly lighted larder.
&#8216;I think they&#8217;d like jam tart and plum-pudding,
don&#8217;t you?&#8217;</p>

<p>She shifted the two delicacies dearest to her
heart on to one dish, and handed it up to Jean,
who stood poised uncertainly on the edge of
the water-butt.</p>

<p>&#8216;The jelly and the cranberry pie look rather
nice,&#8217; said Angela, her own mouth watering for
them, as she passed them out to Jean.</p>

<p>&#8216;Can&#8217;t you find something substantial?&#8217;
urged Jean, when she had deposited the second
load on the ground beside the water-butt.</p>

<p>The two children in the larder looked round
at the well-stocked shelves. There was cold
beef, to be sure, and a large tureen of mutton
broth; but these did not strike them as being
at all the sort of present that any one would
like to have.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>&#8216;Apple dumplings,&#8217; settled Angela, swiftly, as
her eye fell on a large dish full of them; and
they handed the apple dumplings after the
other things, and then followed them by way
of the water-butt to the impatient Jean, who
had already loaded herself with the jelly and
the cranberry pie.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come along!&#8217; said Jean. &#8216;If we&#8217;re not
quick, we shall be late for tea. Besides, we
must get back to see Finny, and explain to her
what we&#8217;ve done. She might be cross if she
found it out for herself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you sure she won&#8217;t be cross anyhow?&#8217;
asked Barbara, as she staggered along in her
wake, carrying the dish that contained the
plum-pudding and the jam tart.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not if we explain exactly why we did it,&#8217;
said Angela, gasping for breath just behind her
companions. She found the apple dumplings
decidedly weighty.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nobody,&#8217; said Jean, emphatically, &#8216;could
mind anything we chose to do in a cause like
this. Besides, there wasn&#8217;t time to ask leave
first, was there? When people haven&#8217;t had
anything to eat for weeks, you can&#8217;t keep them
waiting for food while you ask <i>leave</i>, can you?&#8217;</p>

<p>The shortest cut to the nine-acre field was
across the lawn at the side of the house, and
then through the little gate in the shrubbery.
It was much less secluded than the longer way
by which they had come, but detection had to
be risked, now that the time was so short.
And even if they were caught, as Jean pointed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
out in a whisper, it would be worth while to
suffer in such a noble cause; and as for the
Hearnes, Finny would be sure to send them on
the things as soon as she heard how many
weeks they had been without food.</p>

<p>&#8216;But how can we suffer, if Finny isn&#8217;t going
to be cross about it?&#8217; argued Barbara, becoming
heated in the effort to keep the plum-pudding
from rolling into the jam tart and sticking to it.
&#8216;You said<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>Her sentence was never finished, for just as
they left the shadow of the house and were
going to strike across the lawn, they heard the
click of the little gate opposite, and two figures
emerged suddenly from the shrubbery. There
was still light enough to disclose that they were
the Canon and Barbara&#8217;s disenchanted beast,
the Doctor.</p>

<p>Even then, the triumvirate might have escaped
detection by slipping round to the back
of the house again before they were seen; and
Jean had the presence of mind to sound a
retreat in an agonised whisper, and turned
sharply round herself. But Barbara&#8217;s effort to
follow her example was too much for the uncertain
balance of the plum-pudding. It chose
that very moment to tumble into the jam tart,
and the two slid together from the dish and
rolled to the feet of the astonished Canon.</p>

<p>&#8216;Upon my word,&#8217; exclaimed the old gentleman,
starting violently, &#8216;Elizabeth&#8217;s establishment
is full of surprises!&#8217;</p>

<p>The triumvirate kept very close together at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
the edge of the grass lawn, and waited for the
two gentlemen to approach. Very little of
their enthusiasm remained to keep up their
spirits, for the erratic behaviour of the plum-pudding
made even the pursuit of good works
seem foolish and unnecessary.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are you children doing here?&#8217; asked
the Canon, and his voice distinctly took a note
of disapproval. He did not know very much
about girls, though his niece assured him they
were not unlike little boys; but he was quite
sure that it was not the right thing for plum-puddings
to be rolling across the lawn at that
time of day, and disapproval seemed to be
demanded by the circumstance.</p>

<p>The effect on the three children of his mild
attempt at severity was immediate. Babs was
struck dumb by it; anything so dreadful as the
anger of a Canon had never occurred to her as
a possible result of feeding the poor, and she
had to think it all over before she could say
anything. Angela put down the apple dumplings,
the weight of which had become intolerable,
and began to cry softly. Jean pulled
herself together with a frantic effort, and
clutched the dish she was holding so fiercely
that the jelly on the summit of the cranberry
pie shivered and shook.</p>

<p>&#8216;It was my fault,&#8217; she blurted out, looking
steadfastly over the edge of the dish at the
well-blacked boots of the Canon. &#8216;I made
them go out of bounds, and visit the poor, and&#8211;and
climb into the larder window to fetch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
things for the woman who looked so hungry.
They wouldn&#8217;t have gone, if it hadn&#8217;t been for
me. I made them&#8211;it was my fault.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, it wasn&#8217;t; it was all our faults,&#8217; wept
Angela, in a confused mumble.</p>

<p>Babs stepped forward and tried hard not to
break down and cry too. &#8216;Please don&#8217;t rag
Jean for it,&#8217; she begged. &#8216;The boy was crying,
and we all thought it was the opportunity come
at last<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What opportunity?&#8217; asked the Canon, looking
extremely puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8216;To&#8211;to do what you said in your sermon,&#8211;good
works, and feeding the poor, and all
that,&#8217; faltered Barbara. Somehow, when she
expressed it that way, it seemed like putting
the blame on the Canon, and she was sure it
could not be right for a little girl to blame a
Canon. Added to this, she was possessed with
the dread that they had only made themselves
look ridiculous after all; and she expected that
they would all three be very heartily laughed
at, as soon as the old gentleman began to
understand their story. She was determined
in her own mind that if the Doctor should
join in the laugh against them, a certain fairy
prince should be turned once more into a
beast and banished for ever from her kingdom.
She was bound to admit, however, that the
Doctor, so far, had not shown the least interest
in them or their story.</p>

<p>&#8216;But&#8211;but I quite fail to understand,&#8217; said
the Canon, rather testily. &#8216;Who was the boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
you speak of, and what had you to do with
him?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It was Bobby Hearne,&#8217; answered Jean, still
staring down at his boots; &#8216;and if you only
knew how hungry they all looked when we
got to the cottage<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>She was interrupted by the Doctor, who
suddenly behaved in the most extraordinary
manner. For the first time he appeared to
be listening to what they were saying, and
he sprang right in front of the Canon and
grasped Jean by the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you mean to say you have been into
the Hearnes&#8217; cottage?&#8217; he cried, shaking her
in his impatience until the jelly and the cranberry
pie ran some danger of following the
example of the plum-pudding. &#8216;Were you
stupid enough to go right inside?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes!&#8217; answered the triumvirate, with one
voice.</p>

<p>The Doctor took his hand away, and turned
with a shrug of his shoulders to the Canon.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Hearne girl is down with scarlet fever,&#8217;
he said in a suppressed tone.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN &#8216;QUORRANTEEN&#8217;</span></h2>

<p>&#8216;<span class='sc'>My dear darling dearest Father</span>,&#8211;We
are in quorranteen that&#8217;s Jean Murray and
Angela Wilkins and me becos we tried to feed
the poor after the cannon&#8217;s sermon and the
poor had scarlet fever and now praps we shall
have scarlet fever too and in case we do we&#8217;ve
got to stop in quorranteen for eight days and
it&#8217;s an awful shame becourse it gives us such a
little time to practis for the gym prize. The
cannon is Finny&#8217;s uncle and he&#8217;s awfully nice
though a little unreesonable Jean says and Jean
knows bekause her father is a professor and he
has ofered a prize for whoever is best at the
gym display on the break up day. I mean the
cannon and not Jean&#8217;s father. Quorranteen is
a little house built by itself in the garden and
connected with the school by a covvered passage
that leads into the front hall because Jean says
it&#8217;s no use being in quorranteen unless you&#8217;re
quite sure no one can catch things off you so
we are issolated. All the same we do free
exercises every morning just to keep our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
mussels in good order for the gym competition
and I tell them fairy stories when their&#8217;s
nothing else to do and Angela says they&#8217;re not
bad only she likes reel stories best which is a
great pitty becos I don&#8217;t know any reel stories
but still they put up with my kind of stories
very well and Jean says I&#8217;m a funny kid. We
have our dinner early so that we can go out in
the garden while the other girls are having
theirs so that no one can catch anything off us
and we are alowed to go all over Finny&#8217;s
garden as well as the nine aker field and we
are really in a very supperior possition Jean
says. Sumtimes for a great treat one of the
big girls is alowed to come and talk to us from
the garden and we stand at the window and
shout down to her because you can&#8217;t catch
things off people that way Jean says and the
other two nearly always vote for Margaret
that&#8217;s the head girl who is adorrable and divvine
Jean says but I vote for Ruth who is a brick.
The worst of being in quorranteen is that I
have learnt the true charracter of the doctor
and Kit always said he was a beast but I didn&#8217;t
think he was a beast but now I think he must
be rather a beast because he is so horrid and
unsimpathetick he always behaves as if we
were very naughty and wicked for wanting to
feed the poor and giving such a lot of trubble
insted of understanding that it was all the
cannon&#8217;s fault for preaching that sermon which
meant something quite diferent and how were
we to know that the poor had scarlet fever?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
I think we were rather silly and it was our silly
silliness that I minded most but the doctor
doesn&#8217;t seem to think that and he looks at our
tungs and he says what&#8217;s that? to every paper
bag he sees about in the quorranteen which is
only hardbake or chocalate from the big girls.
Jean says he is much nicer to me than to
Angela or her but I haven&#8217;t noticed any diference
myself and I don&#8217;t want him to be nice to
me if he isn&#8217;t nice to them it isn&#8217;t fair or above
bord is it father? Anuther bother is that
Finny hasn&#8217;t said a word to us yet about feeding
the poor and giving such a lot of trubble
and I think she&#8217;s very cross and is saving up
for an enormous skolding but Jean says no it&#8217;s
Finny&#8217;s way to give us time to think it over
before she says anything and it&#8217;s just dissipline
Jean says. Besides, she can&#8217;t be very cross or
else she wouldn&#8217;t have gone on feeding the
poor I mean the Hearnes ever since we came
into the quorranteen which is what she&#8217;s been
doing because she told us so and they haven&#8217;t
had to go into the workhouse after all.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara had scribbled so far uninterrupted,
but when she picked up her third sheet of exercise
paper and began to cover that too, the
patience of her companions became exhausted.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say,&#8217; said Jean, yawning, &#8216;I wish you&#8217;d
stop writing and talk; I never knew any one
so fond of writing as you are, Babe.&#8217;</p>

<p>Quarantine, after nearly a week of it, was
beginning to lose its novelty, and all the paper
bags that the sure aim of the head girl managed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
to deposit in their prison did not make up for
the many hours of her society that they were
unable to enjoy. Even the arithmetic lessons
of Miss Tomlinson, and the plain-work evenings
conducted by &#8216;Smithy,&#8217; would not have seemed
nearly so unattractive now as they did a week
ago.</p>

<p>&#8216;All right,&#8217; said Babs, putting down her blue
pencil; &#8216;I don&#8217;t mind stopping, but I thought
Angela didn&#8217;t want to talk.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean glanced round at Angela, and Angela
immediately put her hand to her head and
sighed heavily. She had been doing this for
some minutes without making any effect upon
Barbara, although Barbara had been the first
to notice that there was something unusual in
her behaviour. That was so like Babs! She
was always the first to notice anything, but she
had such an unsatisfactory way of passing it
over, whatever it was, that it was no advantage
to anybody unless some one else noticed
it too.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hullo!&#8217; said Jean, staring; &#8216;what&#8217;s the
matter, Angela?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve got a splitting headache,&#8217; murmured
Angela, half closing her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8216;Anything else?&#8217; asked Jean, becoming
interested.</p>

<p>&#8216;My throat is rather sore, I think, and&#8211;and
I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m feverish,&#8217; answered Angela,
faintly; and she shivered to show how feverish
she was.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh,&#8217; said Barbara, opening her eyes, &#8216;that&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
how Dr. Hurst said it began; and then Finny
dragged him away, and we didn&#8217;t hear any
more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Don&#8217;t</i> say anything so dreadful,&#8217; murmured
Angela, complacently. &#8216;What shall I do if I
can&#8217;t go in for the competition?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Besides, you might have it very badly and
die,&#8217; said Jean, consolingly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, you might. We knew a boy on the
opposite side of the square, and <i>he</i> died,&#8217; remarked
Babs. &#8216;Only, I&#8217;m not sure if it was
scarlet fever. His sister used to come and tell
us about it, and she said he had a kettle with a
long spout in his room, all day long, and it
puffed out smoke at him, and made such a
funny gurgling sound that she used to be afraid
to pass his door after dark. Perhaps it wasn&#8217;t
scarlet fever,&#8217; she added, out of consideration
for Angela, &#8216;but he did die.&#8217;</p>

<p>Angela looked from one to the other and
shook her head mournfully. &#8216;I expect it was,&#8217;
she said. &#8216;It sounds exactly like it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, yes,&#8217; continued Jean, cheerfully. &#8216;I
<i>know</i>, because a cousin of mine had something
that was catching once, and she nearly lost her
sight through it, and she&#8217;s had to wear spectacles
ever since, and her eyes are all red and shiny,
and she looks a hideous sight. I expect that
was scarlet fever too.&#8217;</p>

<p>Angela shuddered, and quite closed her eyes
that time. Her two comforters looked at each
other expressively.</p>

<p>&#8216;Poor Angela!&#8217; said Jean, stroking her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
forehead. &#8216;It&#8217;s awful hard lines that you should
be the one to catch it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, never mind about that,&#8217; answered the
victim, meekly. &#8216;I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s me and not you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Lots of people don&#8217;t die, you know,&#8217; added
Barbara, taking hold of her hand and waggling
it up and down in a way that was intended to
express sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8216;N&#8211;no,&#8217; said Angela, with some reluctance;
&#8216;but lots of people do. Anyhow, I hope I
shall be brave, whatever happens.&#8217; And she
stifled a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course you will,&#8217; said Jean, warmly. &#8216;<i>We</i>
know that!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If&#8211;if this should be the last time we are
together before they separate us,&#8217; continued
Angela, opening her eyes again and looking up
at them appealingly, &#8216;you <i>will</i> remember, won&#8217;t
you, that<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>The door opened and put an abrupt stop to
her pathetic last request. The triumvirate, still
clasping hands affectionately, looked round and
met the astonished gaze of the head-mistress.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter with Angela?&#8217; she inquired
briskly.</p>

<p>Angela closed her eyes again hastily. The
other two prepared valiantly to defend her
position.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s got a headache and a sore throat, and
she&#8217;s feverish,&#8217; answered Jean, glibly.</p>

<p>&#8216;She thinks she&#8217;s got it,&#8217; added Babs, coming
straight to the point.</p>

<p>They fully expected Miss Finlayson to do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
something startling to show her concern at
the approaching peril of Angela; but Miss
Finlayson merely smiled.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, so that&#8217;s what she thinks, is it?&#8217; she
observed. &#8216;And may I ask if that is why you
have chosen this particular moment to hang
over her more closely than usual?&#8217;</p>

<p>The triumvirate loosed hands, and Miss
Finlayson came and looked very sharply at the
unconscious features of the sufferer; then she
suddenly whipped a thermometer out of her
pocket and into the open mouth before her.
Angela sat up in dismay, and tried to protest;
but Miss Finlayson smiled again and pressed
her gently back.</p>

<p>&#8216;You mustn&#8217;t speak, or we shall not be able
to find out your temperature,&#8217; she said, and
Angela put on a resigned air, and suffered in
silence.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now,&#8217; continued the head-mistress, pleasantly,
&#8216;we can have a few minutes&#8217; conversation,
while we are waiting to discover whether
Angela has scarlet fever or not. To begin
with, I want to ask you if you remembered,
when you went out of bounds last Thursday,
that you were abusing the trust I had placed in
you? Recollect!&#8211;I do not keep policemen at
every corner to spy over you when you are left
to yourselves, but I do put you on your honour
not to do anything you know I have forbidden.
Did you think of this, Jean?&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean reddened and looked down.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, I didn&#8217;t,&#8217; she blurted out. &#8216;I forgot all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
about the bounds, at first, and I only thought
you would like us to feed the poor, and it
was such a grand opportunity. And then,
afterwards<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes&#8211;afterwards?&#8217; said Miss Finlayson,
encouragingly, as Jean hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8216;Afterwards, when I saw that woman look
like she did, I never thought of you or anything,&#8217;
she muttered with an effort; and she
was very red indeed by the time she had
finished.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson took her hand and held it
between her own, and then turned to Barbara.</p>

<p>&#8216;Was that your reason too, Babs?&#8217; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, it wasn&#8217;t,&#8217; answered Babs, without
hesitation. &#8216;I did remember about going out
of bounds directly we climbed over the gate;
but I saw the other two had forgotten, so I
didn&#8217;t say anything.&#8217;</p>

<p>The thermometer nearly fell out of Angela&#8217;s
mouth from surprise at this amazing admission;
and Jean felt compelled to say something in
Barbara&#8217;s defence.</p>

<p>&#8216;You see, the boy was crying so,&#8217; she
interrupted anxiously; &#8216;and I suppose Babs
thought<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hush!&#8217; said the head-mistress, softly; &#8216;I
want Babs to tell me what she thought.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara was almost as red as Jean by this
time. &#8216;I didn&#8217;t think about the boy, or the
poor, or anything,&#8217; she confessed; &#8216;but I
wanted to see whether the lane did lead to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
the enchanted grotto, where the beautiful
princess<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>She paused, because she remembered just in
time that nobody ever understood about those
things. Miss Finlayson was watching her
carefully.</p>

<p>&#8216;And did it?&#8217; she asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh no,&#8217; said Barbara; &#8216;it was <i>horrible</i> when
it got round the corner.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson nodded, and smiled her own
mysterious smile. Then she took the thermometer
out of Angela&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>&#8216;And what was your reason, Angela?&#8217; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; said Angela, rather foolishly.
&#8216;Jean said &#8220;Come on!&#8221; and we&#8217;d promised to
share the first opportunity that came; and Babs
went, and so of course I went too.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson looked relieved. &#8216;You have
made me feel much happier, children,&#8217; she said,
&#8216;because I see now that you did not realise
what you were doing, and that your own
reasons seemed good enough to you at the
time. If I thought I could not trust to your
honour any more, I should be most unhappy.
Do you think you understand?&#8217;</p>

<p>The triumvirate looked very thoughtful.
Angela, who seemed to have forgotten all about
her alarming symptoms, was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8216;I suppose I ought to have found out
whether the others were right before I followed
them,&#8217; she said.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson nodded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>&#8216;And we ought to have made sure we were
right ourselves before we let her follow us,
because Angela always follows,&#8217; added Jean.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson nodded again.</p>

<p>Barbara roused herself and shook back her
hair. &#8216;I was the worst,&#8217; she said impetuously.
&#8216;I did remember about the bounds, and the
others didn&#8217;t until afterwards. But I forgot
about the honour part, truthfully!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; answered the head-mistress; &#8216;you
were the worst, Babs; and you soon found out
that the lane did not lead to the enchanted
grotto, didn&#8217;t you? Now, what we can all see
very clearly from this conversation is that we
must think a little more carefully in future
before we do things. The rules in my school
are made for people who <i>think</i>, and not for
people who have to be told whether a thing is
right or wrong. People of that kind are not
the people for me. Are you going to let me
trust you again in future, children?&#8217;</p>

<p>There was no doubt whatever from their
faces that they thought she might; but Babs
still wanted something cleared up.</p>

<p>&#8216;Was the Canon&#8217;s sermon all wrong, then?&#8217;
she asked in her straightforward manner. Jean
and Angela looked at the head-mistress
nervously; but Miss Finlayson did not seem
to mind.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Canon&#8217;s sermon was rather like my
rules,&#8217; she pointed out; &#8216;and it was meant for
people who think. It is no use being unselfish
in a thoughtless kind of way, or else you do as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
much harm as most people do by being selfish.
I want you to try very hard to put lots of
thought and cleverness into your good deeds
all your life, so that by the time you are grown
up your good deeds will be really worth doing.
Then you will be able to carry out properly
what the Canon told you; for, to tell the truth,
the Canon&#8217;s sermon was rather meant for
grown-up thinking, and perhaps that is why
you misunderstood it. But children&#8217;s thinking
is worth just as much in its own way; don&#8217;t
forget that, little girls.&#8217;</p>

<p>She jumped up and kissed them all round,
then glanced hastily at her watch. &#8216;It strikes
me,&#8217; she said gravely, &#8216;that if somebody looks
out of the window in five minutes&#8217; time, somebody
will see something in the garden.&#8217;</p>

<p>She was just going out of the room, when
an exclamation from Barbara called her back.
&#8216;Why,&#8217; she said, &#8216;you haven&#8217;t told us about
Angela&#8217;s scarlet fever yet!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No more I have,&#8217; said the head-mistress,
and she took the thermometer to the window
and examined it. Angela tried rather feebly
to recover her resigned expression, which she
had completely dropped in the last few minutes;
and her school-fellows exchanged a look of apprehension.</p>

<p>&#8216;Poor Angela!&#8217; said Miss Finlayson, pensively,
as she dipped the thermometer into a glass of
water.</p>

<p>Angela put her hand to her head, and the
other two closed round her sympathetically.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>&#8216;I am truly sorry for you,&#8217; continued Miss
Finlayson, returning the thermometer to her
pocket and sighing deeply.</p>

<p>The triumvirate gazed at her in a scared
fashion.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is she&#8211;is she going to have scarlet fever,
<i>really</i>?&#8217; asked Barbara, anxiously.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson walked slowly across the
room, shaking her head. She turned when she
reached the door, and her eyes twinkled. &#8216;I
am afraid not,&#8217; she said, and they heard her
laughing to herself as she ran downstairs.</p>

<p>The triumvirate had very little time to congratulate
Angela on her escape before their
attention was caught by a loud &#8216;Coo-ey!&#8217; from
the garden below. Certainly &#8216;quorranteen&#8217;
was full of diversions this afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8216;Kit! Kit! That&#8217;s Kit!&#8217; shouted Babs,
and a series of flying leaps took her across to
the window. In another minute the sash was
flung wide, and she was leaning out as far as
the laws of balance allowed her. She was
right about the &#8216;Coo-ey!&#8217; for there on the lawn
below stood her favourite brother, and by his
side stood Jill and Auntie Anna.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, well,&#8217; said the old lady, leaning on
her blue-knobbed cane and looking more like a
witch than ever, &#8216;and what is the meaning of
this, I should like to know? A fine lot of
trouble you&#8217;re giving people with your tricks,
you young monkey!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s all right,&#8217; Babs assured her; &#8216;we&#8217;ve
made it up with Finny, and she&#8217;s not a bit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
cross, and next time we&#8217;re going to think first,
and we&#8217;re never going to pay a bit of attention
to the old Canon till we&#8217;re grown up. Then
we shan&#8217;t make any more mistakes, she
says.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s to be hoped not, for I think you&#8217;ve
made a young silly of yourself all the same,&#8217; remarked
Christopher, frankly. &#8216;Whatever made
you do it, Babe?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara looked a little crestfallen. It would
be easier to explain their escapade to twenty
Canons than to one brother, even when it was
a favourite brother like Kit. Jill came hurriedly
to the rescue.</p>

<p>&#8216;Never mind about that, Kit,&#8217; she said.
&#8216;Think how lucky it is that she hasn&#8217;t caught
scarlet fever, after all.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara cheered up. &#8216;Even Angela doesn&#8217;t
think she&#8217;s going to have it now,&#8217; she observed;
&#8216;and she&#8217;s been thinking she&#8217;s got it, ever since
we went into quarantine; so we shall be able
to come out again the day after to-morrow.
Of course it means sums and flannel petticoats
and all those horrible things as well; but still,
we shall be able to practise up for the gym
display, and that&#8217;s much more important.
You&#8217;re all coming to the gym display, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rather!&#8217; said Kit. &#8216;It&#8217;s the day after the
others break up; and even Egbert says he
doesn&#8217;t mind coming, though it&#8217;s only a girls&#8217;
school, and he says he doesn&#8217;t expect much.
Of course, Will is awfully keen on coming, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
so is Peter; but that&#8217;s only for the grub, so
don&#8217;t you make any mistake about it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know why Egbert is so mighty
grand,&#8217; objected Barbara. &#8216;Our gym is really
<i>serious</i>, I can tell you. You should see Angela
on the rings; and as for Jean Murray&#8211;why, I
forgot! You don&#8217;t know them yet!&#8217;</p>

<p>She disappeared abruptly from the window,
while Auntie Anna said something about leaving
the young people to themselves, and strolled
off towards the house. Kit was attacked with
a sudden fit of shyness at the prospect of being
presented to two perfectly strange schoolgirls;
and he shouted at Barbara to &#8216;come back and
chuck it!&#8217; But Barbara did not hear him, and
he edged behind Jill for protection.</p>

<p>Upstairs, in the &#8216;quorranteen,&#8217; Barbara was
trying with some difficulty to persuade Jean
and Angela to show themselves.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh no!&#8217; they both said, getting as far away
as possible from the window, and contriving to
look neglected. &#8216;Never mind us, Babe; <i>please</i>
go on talking to your people.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But it&#8217;s <i>Kit</i>!&#8217; represented Babs, as if that
settled the matter at once. &#8216;He&#8217;s my favourite
brother, and he&#8217;s a genius, and he&#8217;s only thirteen,
and he has asthma so badly you&#8217;d think
he was going to die. You <i>must</i> want to know
Kit! Besides, Jill is there too.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Jill Urquhart?&#8217; cried Angela. &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t
you say so before? Of course, we want to
see Jill Urquhart!&#8217;</p>

<p>So the triumvirate squeezed themselves on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
to the narrow window-seat, and hung in a row
over the window-ledge, while Jill smiled and
nodded from below, and said pleasant things to
them in her pretty soft voice. For all that,
her old school-fellows did not feel at their ease
with her; for they had suddenly made the discovery
that Jill Urquhart, who used to be the
privileged possessor of boots to be unlaced and
desks to be put away, and other things now
connected with Margaret Hulme, had somehow
changed into a daintily dressed, grown-up
sort of visitor, who had to hold up her skirt
because the grass was wet. No one, not even
the head girl, held up her skirt at Wootton
Beeches.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is Jean Murray, Kit, and that&#8217;s Angela
Wilkins,&#8217; said Babs, by way of introduction;
and Christopher, who was still seeking protection
behind his cousin, pulled off his cap
and grinned. Then there was a pause, and
the situation became rather strained. Barbara
looked round at her two companions, and could
not imagine what had come over them. Why,
she wondered, did they not chatter away as
they usually did? They only giggled faintly,
however; and Angela was covered with
blushes. So far, the introduction did not
seem a success.</p>

<p>&#8216;Angela can swing and turn and leave go
with one hand and catch on again&#8211;I mean on
the rings,&#8217; said Barbara, by way of opening the
conversation.</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t! What stories! Besides, it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
quite easy; anybody could!&#8217; declared Angela,
vehemently.</p>

<p>&#8216;And Jean can turn coach-wheels as well as
Peter,&#8217; continued Babs, eagerly. &#8216;She can
do hand-balance too, when Hurly-Burly isn&#8217;t
looking; because we&#8217;re not allowed to do hand-balance,
you see, so we&#8217;ve got to wait till no
one is looking. Isn&#8217;t it wonderful of Jean?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How <i>can</i> you, Babe?&#8217; murmured Jean,
reproachfully; and she concealed her confusion
by staring up at the top of the elm tree opposite
and pretending that she was not the person
referred to.</p>

<p>&#8216;They are very clever, aren&#8217;t they, Kit?&#8217;
said Jill, in a gentle, encouraging manner.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, rather!&#8217; said Kit, picking a blade of
grass and gnawing it in his desperation.</p>

<p>&#8216;And it will be most exciting to see Angela
on the rings at the display, won&#8217;t it, Kit?&#8217;
continued Jill, smiling away more pleasantly
than ever.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, rather!&#8217; said Kit, again; and he wound
the blade of grass elaborately round his little
finger.</p>

<p>&#8216;What we can do is nothing to Babs, though!&#8217;
said Angela, making a mighty effort to overcome
her shyness. &#8216;She&#8217;s the best in the
whole school!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, the Babe!&#8217; remarked Christopher, leaving
the shelter of Jill&#8217;s big hat, and suddenly
regaining confidence. &#8216;<i>She</i> doesn&#8217;t count.&#8217;</p>

<p>Conversation flourished more easily after
that, for the triumvirate combined immediately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
in an attempt to prove to Kit that the Babe
did count. Indeed, the argument grew so hot
and furious that the Doctor, who happened at
that moment to make his call upon his small
patients, knocked three times at the door of the
room, and finally had to walk in unannounced.
There was a look of annoyance on his face, for
he already resented being compelled to waste
his precious time in attending three healthy
young schoolgirls who had nothing whatever
the matter with them, and would not have been
in their present plight but for a piece of childish
folly. When he found that his patients had
not even the grace to be ready for his visit, his
irritation increased.</p>

<p>&#8216;Excuse me,&#8217; he began, &#8216;are you aware<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>?&#8217;
He paused and frowned, for it was quite evident
that none of them was aware of anything except
of what was going on in the garden. Nothing
was to be seen of his patients except an array
of black legs along the window-seat; the rest
of them appeared to be hanging over the ledge
outside in a perilous and inelegant position;
and all three of them were gabbling away as
fast as their tongues would let them.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, you wait for the competition, that&#8217;s
all!&#8217; Angela was proclaiming shrilly.</p>

<p>&#8216;It all depends on how soon that stupid
Doctor lets us out of this hole,&#8217; added Jean,
with suppressed scorn in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s so funny; he never says anything
important, and he only looks glum, as if he was
<i>so</i> sorry for himself,&#8217; chimed in Babs, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>Dr. Wilson Hurst tapped his stick smartly
on the table; and there was a sudden pause.
Then came three thuds on the floor by the
window-seat, and the triumvirate stood facing
him in varying stages of confusion.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8211;we didn&#8217;t know you were there,&#8217;
ventured Barbara.</p>

<p>&#8216;So I gathered,&#8217; said the Doctor, without a
smile. &#8216;Will you kindly show me your
tongues?&#8217;</p>

<p>He did not want to see their tongues
particularly; but it seemed the most obvious
means at his disposal for producing silence.
The rapidity with which three tongues simultaneously
darted out for his inspection reminded
him irresistibly of mechanical toys, and he very
nearly allowed himself to smile.</p>

<p>&#8216;That will do,&#8217; he said, controlling himself
sternly; and he took out his watch and felt
Barbara&#8217;s pulse. The moment the child&#8217;s
tongue was her own again, she began to make
use of it.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re sorry that we are not any iller,
aren&#8217;t you, Dr. Hurst?&#8217; she remarked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Eh? What?&#8217; said the Doctor, taken aback.
&#8216;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t know what you are talking
about.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, you always look as though you would
like us so much better if we <i>really</i> had scarlet
fever instead of only waiting for it,&#8217; explained
Babs, pleasantly. &#8216;<i>Would</i> you like
us better, Dr. Hurst, if we really had scarlet
fever?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>She had so nearly guessed the truth with
her quick, impish perception, that the Doctor
dropped her hand abruptly and passed on to
Angela. &#8216;There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much the
matter with any of you,&#8217; he said, by way of
conducting the conversation on strict medical
lines. He looked so cross about it, however,
that the attempt did not prosper. Barbara, in
the innocence of her heart, thought he needed
cheering up.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you coming to the display, Dr. Hurst?&#8217;
she asked politely.</p>

<p>&#8216;The&#8211;I beg your pardon?&#8217; he murmured,
staring hard at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8216;The gymnastic display at the end of the
term, when we&#8217;re going to compete for the
Canon&#8217;s prize, you know,&#8217; proceeded Barbara.
&#8216;Everybody&#8217;s coming&#8211;Jill too! So <i>you</i> will,
won&#8217;t you, Dr. Hurst?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Really, I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; answered the Doctor;
and he dropped Angela&#8217;s hand just as hastily,
and passed on to Jean Murray. Babs looked
a little puzzled for a moment, and then her
face cleared.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, of course, you don&#8217;t like Jill! I&#8217;d
forgotten that,&#8217; she remarked with a smile.
&#8216;But that doesn&#8217;t matter, because you needn&#8217;t
sit next to her, need you? I don&#8217;t think Jill
would mind your not sitting next to her,&#8217; she
added reflectively.</p>

<p>The Doctor began to wish very heartily that
he had accepted Miss Finlayson&#8217;s offer to let
one of the teachers accompany him from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
house, and he prepared to beat a speedy retreat.
But Angela, in her bland and tactless manner,
put the finishing touch to his embarrassment
and cut off his retirement.</p>

<p>&#8216;Jill Urquhart is outside on the lawn now,&#8217;
she observed quite pointlessly.</p>

<p>&#8216;So she is!&#8217; cried Barbara, clapping her
hands. &#8216;Then you&#8217;ll come to the window and
speak to her, won&#8217;t you, Dr. Hurst? Kit is
there too!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You must really excuse me,&#8217; said the Doctor,
stiffly, as he took up his hat and stick; &#8216;but,
really<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Dr. Hurst, <i>do</i> come,&#8217; begged the child,
her little black eyes bright with entreaty. In
spite of her temporary disloyalty during the
period of &#8216;quorranteen&#8217; to the prince who had
once been a beast, she still considered him
worthy to stay in her kingdom with the magician
and other privileged folk; and it really hurt
her to feel that he did not appreciate Jill and
Kit, and that Jill and Kit on their side did
not know he had been disenchanted quite six
weeks ago. Surely, she thought, if they were
all properly brought together, they could not
fail to like one another.</p>

<p>The Doctor hesitated, and Barbara waited
anxiously. He thought he only had to decide
whether he should leave at once, or whether
he should stay and be laughed at by the other
schoolgirl outside&#8211;the one who had made him
feel so stupid at Mrs. Crofton&#8217;s dinner-party.
But to Barbara his decision meant much more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
than that, for it was going to determine whether
a certain beast was a prince, or whether a certain
prince was a beast.</p>

<p>So she waited with a look of thrilling expectancy
on her face; and the other two, who had
never seen her look like that before, began to
feel a little doubtful about the way she was
behaving.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, Babe, don&#8217;t!&#8217; whispered Jean, tugging
at her.</p>

<p>The little movement roused the Doctor, and
recalled him to the absurdity of his position.
He bowed, and walked with sudden determination
to the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Good afternoon,&#8217; he said curtly; and the
disappointment on Barbara&#8217;s face haunted him
in the most tiresome manner for the rest of the
day.</p>

<p>Babs stood motionless for nearly a minute
after he had gone. Then she smiled a little
wistfully to herself.</p>

<p>&#8216;After all, he must have found it rather
lonely without a princess, and I can&#8217;t find a
princess,&#8217; she reflected out loud.</p>

<p>&#8216;What <i>are</i> you talking about?&#8217; asked
Jean.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hadn&#8217;t we better go back to Jill?&#8217; added
Angela, impatiently.</p>

<p>Barbara gave a start. &#8216;What a silly
duffer I am!&#8217; she cried joyfully. &#8216;Of course,
there&#8217;s Jill; and she&#8217;s been there all the
time!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, she has,&#8217; said Jean, bluntly, &#8216;and it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
time you remembered it, for she must be tired
of waiting for us by this<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara interrupted her with another remark&#8211;rather
a mournful one this time.</p>

<p>&#8216;It never comes right,&#8217; she sighed. &#8216;Now,
I&#8217;ve got a princess without a prince!&#8217;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>PREPARING FOR THE DISPLAY</span></h2>

<p>Dr. Hurst did not call again at the little house
in the garden, and the triumvirate came out of
quarantine in due course, very little subdued
by their eight days&#8217; imprisonment, and more on
the alert than ever for any piece of excitement
that might come their way. The junior playroom,
having passed an exceedingly dull and
uneventful week during their absence, welcomed
their return with joy; and it was perhaps
fortunate for the internal affairs of Wootton
Beeches that there was going to be a gymnastic
display to absorb the energies of its wilder
spirits. As the days rolled on and the end of
the term drew nearer and nearer, the conversation
on both sides of the curtain became almost
entirely limited to the one topic of the Canon&#8217;s
prize; and those who were not among the chosen
competitors for it spent the best part of their
time in watching the others practise in the big
gymnasium, and in disputing hotly the various
chances of the claimants. Miss Finlayson had
settled that the six morocco-bound volumes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
offered by her uncle should be divided into two
prizes, one for the senior and one for the junior
division of the school; and while it was generally
agreed that Margaret Hulme would carry
off the first, the discussion in the junior playroom
as to the winner of the second was endless.
Most of the girls were agreed that Charlotte
Bigley and the three members of the triumvirate
shared equal chances, on the whole, of being
successful; and a great deal would depend, it
was said, on the exercises chosen for competition.
For, until a week before the great day,
nobody knew what the exact programme was
to be. &#8216;It&#8217;s one of Finny&#8217;s dodges,&#8217; Charlotte
Bigley declared, &#8216;because she wants us to be
good all round, and not to grind at one or two
things just for the sake of the prize. It&#8217;s like
the prize-giving in the Christmas term; we
never know what the prizes are going to be
for, till after the exams. are over.&#8217;</p>

<p>So the excitement was great when Miss
Burleigh walked into the gymnasium on the
Saturday before the display, and called for
silence so that she might read out the order of
the competition. Even the younger children
forced themselves into a kind of uneasy order,
as Hurly-Burly unfolded her sheet of foolscap
paper; for the next few minutes would practically
decide, they thought, who was to be the
lucky one among the juniors.</p>

<p>&#8216;First of all,&#8217; announced the games-mistress,
&#8216;the whole gymnastic class will open the display
by an exhibition of step-marching.&#8217; This was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
received with average interest, for it sounded
like one of the ordinary gymnastic lessons, and
had nothing to do with the competition. Miss
Burleigh waited for the murmur of comments
to subside, and went on. &#8216;Then the thirty-two
girls chosen to compete for the prize will
separate into two divisions; and the senior
division, led by Margaret Hulme, will perform
the following exercises:&#8211;&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Burleigh paused again, but there were
no comments this time.</p>

<p>&#8216;First, wand exercises by the whole senior
division; then a display on the horizontal bar,
to be followed by one on the vaulting-horse,&#8211;competitors
to choose between the bar and the
horse,&#8211;and the whole to conclude with high
jump. After tea, I will show you the exercises
chosen for competition, and will help you to
divide yourselves into sections.&#8217;</p>

<p>The buzz of remarks from the senior division
lasted almost long enough to shake the loyalty
of the younger children to the head girl; and
they cast many reproachful glances towards the
further end of the gymnasium, where Margaret
formed the centre of an eager, chattering group.
Then Hurly-Burly took pity on them and called
for silence again, and the juniors had their
chance at last.</p>

<p>&#8216;The junior division, led by Charlotte Bigley,
will go through the following exercises:&#8211;&#8217;
began Miss Burleigh. She did not mean to
pause here, but a storm of remonstrance from
the junior division drowned her next words.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>&#8216;Did you <i>ever</i>!&#8217; cried the shrill voice of
Angela Wilkins, who, with Jean and Barbara,
sat perched on the top of the vaulting-horse.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why doesn&#8217;t Jean lead?&#8217; added Babs, indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, please don&#8217;t! I&#8217;m not nearly so good
as you are,&#8217; contradicted Jean, in a faint tone
that lacked conviction.</p>

<p>&#8216;Can&#8217;t you be quiet, you three?&#8217; grumbled
Mary Wells, who had a prejudice against the
triumvirate, founded on many injuries. &#8216;As
if anybody could lead better than Charlotte!
The impudence of <i>some</i> kids<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hush-sh!&#8217; interposed the audience generally,
and Miss Burleigh struggled on.</p>

<p>&#8216;First, Indian clubs for the whole section.
After that<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Jean&#8211;for certain!&#8217; interrupted Barbara,
nodding. &#8216;She bangs every one at clubs!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There you go again!&#8217; said the injured voice
of Mary Wells. &#8216;Everybody knows that
Charlotte<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, stop it!&#8217; said Charlotte herself; and
temporary peace was restored.</p>

<p>&#8216;After that,&#8217; continued Hurly-Burly, rapidly,
&#8216;a display on the horizontal ladder, to be
followed by one on the rings. Competitors to
choose between<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I bag rings!&#8217; screamed Angela, at the top
of her voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, you don&#8217;t!&#8217; said Mary Wells, in her
stolid, aggravating way. &#8216;You&#8217;ve just got to
wait till it&#8217;s settled for you, so there! We all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
know why you&#8217;re so anxious not to do the
ladder; why, you can&#8217;t even manage a simple
travel<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How can you, Mary Wells?&#8217; asked Angela,
solemnly. &#8216;You know I can bear anything but
an untruth; and to say that <i>I</i><span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sh-sh!&#8217; said Miss Burleigh, vigorously, and
she was again allowed a few seconds of silence.
&#8216;The junior division will then conclude with
rope-climbing.&#8217;</p>

<p>Hardly were the words out of her mouth
than her listeners fell to disputing again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Rope-climbing&#8211;Barbara!&#8217; asserted Jean.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are you talking about?&#8217; cried Mary,
with contempt. &#8216;Barbara is simply not <i>in</i> it
with Charlotte; and what&#8217;s more, you know
she isn&#8217;t, Jean Murray.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, the wicked stories some people can
tell,&#8217; sighed Angela. &#8216;Have you seen Barbara
Berkeley swarm up the<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Please, please don&#8217;t,&#8217; implored Babs. &#8216;Can&#8217;t
you see that Hurly-Burly wants to say something
else?&#8217;</p>

<p>Being the champion in question, she could
not very well side with Jean, as she usually did.
Her appeal had some effect on the disputants,
and Miss Burleigh, remembering it was a half-holiday,
shrugged her shoulders good-naturedly
and took advantage of the pause to proceed.</p>

<p>&#8216;The display will take place at five o&#8217;clock
on Thursday,&#8217; she proclaimed; &#8216;supper will be
at seven, and after supper, the Canon, who is
coming from the North on purpose, will give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
away the prizes to the two successful competitors<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s Margaret and Charlotte Bigley,&#8217;
interrupted Mary, noisily; and Hurly-Burly
gave it up and fled, with her hands over her
ears, just as Angela, with a yell of defiance, lost
her balance and plunged down head-first from
her perch on the vaulting-horse.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, no! Margaret and Jean!&#8217; she gasped
out breathlessly, as she scrambled up again
from the floor and brushed the dust from her
hands and knees.</p>

<p>Jean sprang to her feet on the top of the
vaulting-horse, and danced up and down in her
excitement.</p>

<p>&#8216;Margaret and the Babe!&#8217; she shrieked,
waving her arms wildly round her head.</p>

<p>But Barbara had slipped down after Angela,
though not quite so precipitately, and had
retired from the contest to a particular corner
of the gymnasium, where the hot-water pipes
projected sufficiently to form what might with
imagination be considered a seat. It required
some ingenuity, perhaps, to preserve any sort
of balance on the edge of a row of hot-water
pipes; but that was nothing to a small person
who could never sit down tamely on a chair like
other people, but always preferred the slanting
surface of a desk, or something equally unaccommodating.
So Babs felt the hot-water
pipes with her grubby little hands, to make sure
they were just the right heat to be sat upon,
and then squeezed herself on to them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
contentedly, curled her legs away underneath, and
in a few seconds was supremely unconscious of
what was going on at the other end of the
gymnasium. Jean Murray might yell herself
hoarse in her defence, for all she knew or cared;
for at that moment her mind was occupied with
a far more important question.</p>

<p>It was Angela who first grew tired of waging
war with Mary Wells without the valuable
support of Barbara Berkeley. Angela could
shriek with the shrillest, when once some one
had told her what to shriek; but there was a
solid calmness about Mary that carried more
conviction with it, and Barbara&#8217;s wit was the
only thing to make any impression upon that.
Besides, if Angela shrieked &#8216;Margaret and
Jean,&#8217; and Jean shrieked &#8216;Margaret and the
Babe,&#8217; who was there left but the Babe to
shriek for Angela herself? So in a very short
time Angela Wilkins also left the contest, and
found her way to the place where the hot-water
pipes projected into a perch for the youngest
girl in the school.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hullo, Babe! What&#8217;s up?&#8217; she inquired.</p>

<p>Barbara looked at her vaguely. Some one
in a scarlet gymnasium frock certainly stood in
front of her, but it had nothing whatever to do
with what she was worrying over in her mind;
so, at first, she did not take any notice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Aren&#8217;t you coming to practise rings?&#8217; pursued
Angela, who had seen Barbara look like
this before, and knew from experience that in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
time the child would rouse herself sufficiently
to answer her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Rings?&#8217; repeated Babs, vacantly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, come on!&#8217; said Angela, impatiently.
&#8216;How you do moon about the place, to be sure!
Don&#8217;t you want to win the Canon&#8217;s prize?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara&#8217;s expression changed swiftly, and
she frowned. &#8216;Get away,&#8217; she growled, with
unusual fierceness; and Angela stared and
withdrew.</p>

<p>&#8216;Barbara Berkeley is in an awful fury,&#8217; she
announced, when she got back to Jean.</p>

<p>&#8216;What about?&#8217; asked Jean.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, not <i>about</i> anything,&#8217; answered Angela,
shrugging her shoulders. &#8216;When the Babe is
in a fury, it&#8217;s never <i>about</i> anything, is it? It&#8217;s
inside her, or something,&#8217; she added, seeking in
her mind for some explanation of the strange
moods that made Barbara Berkeley a puzzle to
every one.</p>

<p>&#8216;Inside her!&#8217; echoed Mary Wells, scornfully.
&#8216;What you two can see in that child I never
can make out. Fancy making friends with any
one who loses her temper <i>inside</i>!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, it&#8217;s better than losing it <i>outside</i> and
upsetting everybody by howling like a baby,
because you can&#8217;t find your pencil-box, isn&#8217;t it,
stupid?&#8217; cried Jean.</p>

<p>Mary blushed painfully at the personal
reference, and hastily changed the conversation.
&#8216;Barbara Berkeley is a spoilt little kid,&#8217; she retorted.
&#8216;She&#8217;s the most sullen, ill-tempered,
obstinate little<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217; The words stayed at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
tip of her tongue, for the unconscious subject
of them had suddenly joined the group round
Mary, and was staring at her in her most
solemn and disconcerting manner.</p>

<p>Mary Wells felt foolish. There was something
about the youngest girl in the school,
when she looked like that, that would make
any one feel foolish. But Babs had evidently
not heard a word she had been saying.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come on,&#8217; she said, hooking her arm into
Jean&#8217;s; &#8216;I want to ask you something.&#8217;</p>

<p>The two wandered away together down the
long gymnasium.</p>

<p>&#8216;Look here,&#8217; began Barbara, impetuously, as
soon as they were out of hearing of the others.
&#8216;Are you keen on winning that prize?&#8217;</p>

<p>Jean drew a long breath. She wanted to
take that prize back with her to the little home
in Edinburgh, where she had been adored and
spoiled for twelve whole years, more than she
had ever wanted anything in the world; and
she did not know how to answer Barbara&#8217;s unexpected
question.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why?&#8217; she asked, at length.</p>

<p>Barbara took hold of a rope and waved it
backwards and forwards to give herself courage.
&#8216;Because,&#8217; she blurted out, &#8216;I want to get it
too,&#8211;<i>awfully</i>, and so does Angela, and&#8211;and
we can&#8217;t all get it, can we?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said Jean, looking at her curiously.
She had thought she really was beginning to
understand the Babe; and here she was, showing
herself in a more puzzling light than ever.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>&#8216;You see,&#8217; Barbara went on, swarming up
the rope a couple of feet and making her next
remark to the black hook in the beam above,
&#8216;I&#8217;d like awfully to win it, because I don&#8217;t want
the boys to think I&#8217;ve got too much like a girl
to do things now; and because it&#8217;s so&#8211;so
splendid to feel you <i>can</i> do things.&#8217;</p>

<p>She slid down the rope again, and Jean saw
how her eyes were glowing and shining, and
she felt a little more puzzled than before.</p>

<p>&#8216;Then, Angela wants to get it because she&#8217;s
always bottom in everything else,&#8217; continued
Barbara. &#8216;That&#8217;s not much of a reason, I
think, especially when she hasn&#8217;t got any
brothers&#8211;only millions of sisters, who don&#8217;t
count; but still, she&#8217;ll be awfully disappointed
if she doesn&#8217;t get it, won&#8217;t she?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Jean.</p>

<p>Babs curled the rope round her waist, and
swung herself gently to and fro. The movement
seemed to aid her reflections. &#8216;Why do
<i>you</i> want to get it, Jean?&#8217; she asked softly.</p>

<p>It was never easy to induce Jean to talk
about herself; but if any one could do it,
Barbara was the person. And, this time, she
succeeded.</p>

<p>Jean drew another long breath, and clenched
her fists.</p>

<p>&#8216;Because I want to be first,&#8217; she said slowly.
&#8216;I want to be first in <i>everything</i>. I&#8217;d sooner be
bottom than second! Of course you&#8217;ll think
I&#8217;m a conceited pig,&#8217; she added, almost fiercely,
&#8216;but I can&#8217;t help that; I don&#8217;t expect you to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
understand.&#8217; Then she muttered in a lower
tone,&#8211;&#8216;Nobody ever does, excepting only
mother and father.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara&#8217;s eyes were fixed on her face, and
there was a warmth in their blackness that Jean
had only seen there once, and that was when
she was writing to her father in America.</p>

<p>&#8216;Good old Jean!&#8217; she murmured. &#8216;It&#8217;s
awfully hard to understand; but I&#8217;ll try&#8211;<i>truthfully</i>.
And I&#8217;d like you to get the prize&#8211;I
would, really. I didn&#8217;t want you to have it
before; but I do now, Jean, old girl!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I ought to want <i>you</i> to have it, but I don&#8217;t,&#8217;
sighed Jean, trying vainly not to be behindhand
in unselfishness; &#8216;I just want it myself, so it&#8217;s
no good pretending I don&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was silence between them for an
instant; and from the other end of the gymnasium
drifted the monotonous war-cries of Mary
Wells and Angela Wilkins.</p>

<p>&#8216;Margaret and Charlotte Bigley!&#8217; shouted one.</p>

<p>&#8216;Margaret and Jean Murray!&#8217; added the
other.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm was too infectious to be resisted.
With a wild scream of glee, Jean and
Babs raced the whole length of the room and
flung themselves into the fray, without a thought
of the opposite sentiments they had just been
expressing to each other.</p>

<p>&#8216;Margaret and the Babe!&#8217; yelled Jean,
brandishing an Indian club.</p>

<p>&#8216;Margaret and Angela!&#8217; came from the
panting Barbara, just behind her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>Nothing but the entrance of Finny would
have calmed the noisy tumult; but when they
saw her standing on the platform, looking down
at them with her best Saturday smile on her
face, the clamour ended in a burst of laughter;
and five or six of the more eager of them
invaded the platform, and danced round her
appealingly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do, do say who&#8217;s going to win,&#8217; begged
Barbara, catching hold of her sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s Margaret and the Babe, isn&#8217;t it?&#8217; cried
Jean.</p>

<p>&#8216;No!&#8217; shrilled Angela. &#8216;You mean Margaret
and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Charlotte Bigley!&#8217; gasped Mary Wells,
squeezing herself into the front rank.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson put out her arms and encircled
as many of them as she could, and spun
them round the platform with her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dear, dear little girls!&#8217; she exclaimed, when
she was out of breath and could dance no more.
&#8216;Do you know what the Canon ought to have
done, if he wanted to please <i>me</i>?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What? What?&#8217; cried a dozen voices.</p>

<p>&#8216;He ought to have offered thirty-two prizes,
and then I should not have been afraid of any
of my children feeling disappointed,&#8217; answered
Miss Finlayson, nodding at them wisely; and,
somehow, it seemed to Jean as if the head-mistress&#8217;s
eyes rested longest of all upon her.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GYMNASTIC DISPLAY</span></h2>

<p>The junior division, drawn up in double file,
stood assembled in the anteroom of the gymnasium,
on the day of the great competition
for the Canon&#8217;s prize. The figure-marching
by the whole class was over, and the senior
division had just begun the wand exercises to
the piano accompaniment of the German music-master,
who, being the unlucky possessor of an
unpronounceable name in three syllables, was
generally known as &#8216;Scales.&#8217; The applause
which had followed after the marching had
taken away the first shyness of the younger
children; and even the prospect of doing
separate exercises presently, before an audience
of strangers, did not seem to be having much
effect on the sixteen little girls in scarlet frocks
who were waiting in the anteroom for their
turn to come. Hurly-Burly, though supposed
to be superintending affairs in the gymnasium,
had to look in at the door more than once, to
remind them that the crashing chords of
&#8216;Scales&#8217; did not drown everything; but just as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
she had succeeded in reducing them at last to
order, a piece of information passed down the
file from Charlotte Bigley, who stood nearest
the doorway and had the best view of the
gymnasium, upset them all once more.</p>

<p>&#8216;Margaret has forgotten the figure,&#8217; &#8216;Margaret
has put the others out,&#8217; &#8216;Margaret has
gone wrong,&#8217; &#8216;Margaret Hulme has clean forgotten
everything, and she&#8217;s got to step out,&#8217;
were the various forms in which the news
travelled down to the end of the file, the last of
all being the version of Angela Wilkins and
therefore generally discredited.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t believe a word of it!&#8217; said Jean,
stoutly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, Margaret couldn&#8217;t go wrong if she
tried,&#8217; exclaimed Barbara, whose belief in the
head girl, though slow in coming, was quite
equal by this time to Jean&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8216;She has, though,&#8217; declared Angela, who
stood with Mary Wells just in front of Jean
and Barbara.</p>

<p>Mary Wells, who had stepped out of rank
on hearing the surprising news, now returned,
and in her slow and conscientious manner proceeded
to reprove Angela.</p>

<p>&#8216;How you do exaggerate, Angela!&#8217; she said,
frowning. &#8216;Margaret only went a little wrong;
and she&#8217;s caught up again all right. Isn&#8217;t it
funny, though?&#8217; she was obliged to add immediately,
with a thrill of amazement in her voice.</p>

<p>The two children behind her for once were
dumb. The head girl, according to their simple
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
creed, could do no wrong; so when she did,
what words had they left to use? Babs was
the first to see a way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8216;I know,&#8217; she said. &#8216;I expect she&#8217;s nervous.
It makes you forget like anything, if you&#8217;re
nervous. Once, when Egbert was being prepared
for confirmation, he was so nervous&#8211;it
was a strange clergyman, you know, and
Egbert said he blinked&#8211;that he clean forgot
his catechism, even the easy first part about
your godfathers and godmothers. So that&#8217;s
why Margaret forgot her steps, you see if it
wasn&#8217;t!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nervous!&#8217; echoed Jean, incredulously.
&#8216;Who ever saw Margaret nervous? Do you
think she&#8217;d be able to make every new kid who
comes to the school quake in her shoes if she
was <i>nervous</i>?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; answered Babs, doubtfully.
Margaret Hulme had certainly never made her
quake in her shoes, even when she was a new
girl; but she did not admit this to Jean.
&#8216;Egbert can make people afraid of him too,&#8217;
she went on, &#8216;and he can thrash any chap you
please, and he always washes his head in cold
water <i>every</i> morning, even if there&#8217;s ice, and he
has more ties and clothes and things than all
the others put together, and he&#8217;s awfully grand
and splendid, Egbert is,&#8211;but all the same, he
was frightened of that strange clergyman.
Can you see Egbert?&#8217; she concluded proudly.
&#8216;He&#8217;s at the end of them all, next to Jill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
Wasn&#8217;t it jolly of Finny to put them right in
the front row of the gallery?&#8217;</p>

<p>Her companions forgot Margaret for a
minute or two in their efforts to stand on tiptoe
and catch a glimpse through the open door
of Barbara Berkeley&#8217;s five brothers. The
various relatives who came to the break-up
parties, and never seemed to exist at any other
time except on letter-writing days, always caused
a good deal of excitement among the girls, and
added a temporary importance to the most
insignificant of them, provided she was lucky
enough to possess a parent or even a cousin
among the visitors.</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;re all mine,&#8217; said Babs, glowing with
the joy of possession. &#8216;I&#8217;ll introduce them to
you at supper, if you like.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m rather glad I haven&#8217;t any one belonging
to me here,&#8217; said Jean, cheating herself
into a brief forgetfulness of the little home in
Edinburgh. &#8216;I&#8217;m so frightened of the introducing
part; I never know what to say, and it
makes me feel such a goat.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh,&#8217; said Mary Wells, placidly; &#8216;how funny
of you, Jean. I always say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s my sister,
and this is Charlotte Bigley.&#8221; That&#8217;s quite
easy, surely.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, but it isn&#8217;t right,&#8217; responded Jean,
frankly. &#8216;You should hear Margaret Hulme
do it&#8211;that&#8217;s something like! It reminds you
of mothers, and callers, and At Home days when
you wear your best frock and hand the scones.&#8217;</p>

<p>Their talk was interrupted by the retirement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
from the gymnasium of the senior division.
Margaret marched into the anteroom, with her
eyes staring straight in front of her, and an
exaggerated air of confidence in her bearing.
There was an obvious lack of enthusiasm
among her followers, who were all whispering
and looking significantly at their leader; but
the noise produced by Scales, who seemed to
think that a Beethoven sonata was an appropriate
solo to play in the interval, made conversation
impossible; and the section that was
to do the horizontal bar, led by Ruth Oliver,
returned to the gymnasium before the juniors
were able to satisfy their curiosity. During
the second event of the competition, Margaret
and the vaulting-horse section exchanged very
few remarks, and the feeling that there was
something unusual in the air had considerably
increased by the time Ruth, looking flushed
and totally unlike herself, marched her section
back again. The rumour ran down the junior
file that Ruth Oliver had been distinguishing
herself, and that as much of the clapping as
Scales allowed to be heard was on her account.
Certainly, the irresolute manner that marked
everything Ruth did, as a rule, had quite
deserted her as she filed past the triumvirate
with her little band.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; exclaimed Angela, audibly, &#8216;I never
knew Ruth Oliver was pretty before!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She isn&#8217;t, is she?&#8217; said Jean, just as loudly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course she is!&#8217; declared Babs, warmly.
&#8216;She&#8217;s <i>beautiful</i>, and&#8211;and classic!&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>The others laughed, and she wondered why.
Somebody had said, only the other day, that
Jill Urquhart had classic features; and how
was she to know that, although she was every
bit as fond of Ruth as of Jill, the same adjective
would not do for both?</p>

<p>&#8216;Look at Margaret Hulme,&#8217; whispered Mary
Wells, as the vaulting-horse section marched
past them. &#8216;She&#8217;s quite white!&#8217;</p>

<p>The little remark was enough to set them
all wondering afresh; and Barbara, moved by
a sudden impulse, darted up to Ruth Oliver.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Did</i> Margaret go wrong in the wands?&#8217;
asked the child, in an anxious whisper.</p>

<p>The smile that had made Ruth look so
surprisingly pretty died out of her face, and
she glanced gravely down at her little questioner.</p>

<p>&#8216;Never mind, baby,&#8217; she said gently. &#8216;Go
back to your place.&#8217; And she came as near
snubbing any one then as she ever did in the
whole of her school career.</p>

<p>A burst of applause put every one in the
anteroom once more on the alert.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it?&#8217; passed eagerly from one to
another. The answer, given by Charlotte from
her point of vantage near the doorway, was
soon circulated. Margaret Hulme had easily
surpassed her seven companions by a brilliant
performance on the vaulting-horse; and the
spirits of the anteroom went up with a bound.
Hurly-Burly had mounted the platform at the
farther end of the gymnasium, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
comparing notes with Miss Finlayson and the
expert from the London training-college, who
was acting as one of the judges; so there was
no one to restrain both senior and junior
divisions from falling out of rank and pressing
round the head girl, as she once more marched
back to them. They had never once made so
much fuss over their idol as they did now that
she had shown, for the first time, that even
idols are capable of failure.</p>

<p>Hurly-Burly returned and restored order in
a stern voice; and they saw Finny standing in
the middle of the platform, waiting for Scales
to bring the <i>Erlknig</i> to a thundering close.
The next moment she was speaking in that
low voice of hers that went straight to the ears
of every one in the room.</p>

<p>&#8216;It may make the end of the senior competition
more interesting to you,&#8217; she began,
&#8216;if you know how the competitors stand now.
So far, Ruth Oliver is a little ahead of the
others<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217; Even the solemnity of the occasion
could not stay the murmur of astonishment
that rose in the anteroom at this announcement;
but Miss Finlayson waited for it to
subside, and finished her speech. &#8216;She and
Margaret Hulme are very close, for they are
exactly even as regards gymnastics; but Margaret
lost a little over the wand figure. So
the prize will greatly depend upon the result
of the high jump. At the same time, I feel
sure you will agree with me that the way in
which the other competitors have worked has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
greatly added to our enjoyment, and deserves
much of our applause.&#8217;</p>

<p>A good many downcast faces in the anteroom
cheered up as Miss Finlayson made her
ingenious reference to the unsuccessful ones,
and so contrived to make them feel that the
applause at the end of her speech was really
for them. Then the whole senior division
filed into the gymnasium for the last time, to
the slow music of Herr Scales, who had just
had a polite rebuke from Hurly-Burly, and
was forcing himself desperately to keep the
soft pedal down.</p>

<p>The children never forgot the tense feeling
of the next few minutes, the thrill that ran
through every girl in Wootton Beeches when
Ruth Oliver knocked down the rope at four
feet four, the answering thrill that followed it
when she cleared it at four feet six, the surprise
they went through when Margaret also cleared it
at four feet six, but knocked it down at four
feet eight; and last of all, the enthusiasm of the
spectators when Ruth just managed to clear it
at four feet eight and Margaret still knocked
it down after two tries at it. The people,
who clapped and smiled so good-naturedly,
little knew that the exciting contest they
had just witnessed had upset the traditions
of two and a half years and proclaimed the
triumph of the most retiring girl in the school.
They only thought how modern and delightful
it was for girls to play the same games as boys;
and Mrs. Oliver beamed on every one from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
platform, and decided that Ruth should stay
another year at school instead of leaving at midsummer.
But the anteroom was overwhelmed.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s&#8211;impossible!&#8217; gasped Jean, when the
news travelled down to the triumvirate. &#8216;Why,
Margaret can clear four feet ten <i>easily</i>! I&#8217;ve
seen her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And Ruth has never done more than four
feet six before,&#8217; added Angela, forced by the
seriousness of the moment into a strict statement
of facts.</p>

<p>&#8216;Margaret was nervous; I&#8217;m certain she
was,&#8217; said Barbara, positively. &#8216;It was the
same with Egbert, when he forgot his godfathers
and godmothers; he said there was a
silly idiot at the bottom of his form, who didn&#8217;t
mind the strange clergyman blinking at him a
bit, and he even got through the duty to his
neighbour. And Ruth wasn&#8217;t nervous, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What nonsense you are talking,&#8217; remarked
Mary Wells, who loved to be literal. &#8216;Why,
Ruth is more shy than any one in the whole
school!&#8217;</p>

<p>That was certainly true, and Babs went on
puzzling over it, long after Margaret and Ruth
had retired hand in hand to the other end of
the anteroom. For whatever the head girl
felt about her failure, she did not mean to let
any one guess that she cared. Her easy self-possession
was all her own again, as she kept
tight hold of Ruth&#8217;s hand and chatted lightly
to the girls about her; and one or two of the
others, who tried to patronise her with their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
consolation, received such sarcastic replies that
they were very soon put back in their place
again. Margaret Hulme was not going to forget
she was head girl, even if that roomful of
strangers had robbed her of the power she had
wielded for two and a half years.</p>

<p>Scales struck up a march of his own composition;
and at a vigorous sign from Miss
Burleigh, Charlotte Bigley hastily marshalled
her scattered troop and led them into the
gymnasium for the Indian club performance.
They were all very much subdued by the time
they had separated to their various places, for
the peep they had stolen through the anteroom
door had given them no idea of what it
really felt like to stand in the middle of this
staring crowd of people, who filled the gallery
above and the platform at the end, and even
spread thinly round the room close up to the
wall. Jean clenched her teeth and frowned
fiercely, and would have endured twice the
shyness that tortured her sooner than forget
one of the exercises she had to go through;
and as for Barbara, she took no notice of the
people at all, but began to work mechanically,
as soon as the first bars of the familiar valse
fell on her ears. Angela, however, lost her
head and one of her clubs at the same instant;
and a harmless aunt, who sat near, only escaped
a severe blow from the latter by the dexterity
of another visitor, who put out his hand just in
time and caught it as it flew past him. It was
neatly done, and the audience applauded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
vigorously, while Hurly-Burly gave the command to
stop practice, and the stranger restored her
property to the confused and unhappy Angela.
Then Babs recognised him. It was the Doctor
who had come out in this surprisingly new
light; and even Kit, with whom she immediately
exchanged glances, was looking down at
him approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did you see Dr. Hurst?&#8217; whispered Babs
to Jean afterwards, as they filed out of the
gymnasium again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course I did, directly I got in,&#8217; answered
Jean. &#8216;Couldn&#8217;t think who it was looking so
glum and thundery! Wonder why he came to
a show like this? He doesn&#8217;t look as though
he went in for gymnastics, does he?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; said Babs, trying to be fair
even to the beast who had not shown himself
worthy to be a prince. &#8216;It was very smart the
way he caught that club. Perhaps he is good
at gym, though he can&#8217;t take a joke.&#8217;</p>

<p>Angela required so much consolation from
them both on account of her blunder, that they
forgot all about the doctor, and spent most of
their time, while Charlotte&#8217;s section was displaying
on the horizontal ladder, in assuring
her, with more or less confidence in their tones,
that when it came to the rings no one could
hope to compete with her. Then Charlotte
Bigley returned at the head of her section,
trying unsuccessfully to look as if nothing had
happened; and Mary Wells proudly informed
all those who cared to hear, that if anybody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
thought she was going to do the rings as well
as Charlotte had just done the ladder, she was
much mistaken!</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, you shut up!&#8217; rejoined Babs. &#8216;You
haven&#8217;t seen Angela yet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Or Jean!&#8217; echoed Angela, faithfully.</p>

<p>The third voice for once was wanting. Jean
Murray stood waiting for the signal to advance;
and her determined, almost dogged look was
blotting out every other expression on her thin,
clever face.</p>

<p>Babs understood, and sprang forward to her
place at Jean&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s all right, Jean,&#8217; she said earnestly. &#8216;I
must try my very hardest, because Finny made
us all promise; but&#8211;but I do want you to
win, all the same.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, stop it, Babe,&#8217; Jean threw back at her,
in a tone that startled and hurt her; and the
child shrank into herself again, and had a
hard fight to keep back the tears that rushed
into her eyes for the first time in many
weeks.</p>

<p>Their persistent encouragement of Angela
made her go through the first exercise on the
rings successfully. It was a swing and a pull
up in front, and she managed it more neatly
than either of her supporters. Then came the
swing and turn, and here Angela&#8217;s temporary
courage deserted her. Perhaps she was flurried
by the little attempt made by the gallery to
applaud her the second time she came forward;
in any case, the glimpse she had of Kit, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
caught her eye and nodded cheerfully just as
she was beginning, did not help to compose
her. She turned too soon and too vigorously,
and spun round helplessly in the air, until Hurly-Burly
came to her aid and helped her to drop
ignominiously to the ground. After that, it
was evident that the issue of the competition
rested with Jean and Barbara, for they soon
showed that they were much more finished and
thorough in their work than any one else in
their section; and everybody was prepared for
the statement made by Miss Finlayson in the
next interval. She announced that Charlotte
Bigley, Jean Murray, and Barbara Berkeley
were exactly even up to that point, and that the
result would have to be determined by the
rope-climbing.</p>

<p>The rope-climbing, however, left the result
still undetermined. Both Jean and Babs reached
the top in six seconds, blew the trumpet they
found there with a vigour that sent the spectators
into a peal of merriment, and slid down again,
much pleased with themselves and the interest
they were exciting. Charlotte Bigley on the
third rope excelled them in speed and reached
the top in five seconds, but forgot to blow the
trumpet, and so made things even once more.
The junior division filed out again, while Miss
Finlayson and the expert and Hurly-Burly
put their heads together on the platform, and
Herr Scales thought the moment an appropriate
one for a performance in his best
manner of his favourite composition, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
was called <i>Sonnenschein</i> and had been thumped
out in the holidays to half the parents in the
room.</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson rose to her feet again. As
the three competitors she had already mentioned
were still equal, she must call upon each of them
to do one of the advanced exercises, Charlotte
on the ladder and the other two on the rings;
they were to choose their own exercises, and if
they again proved themselves equally good, the
prize would be divided. The spectators were
in a pleasant state of interest by this time,
and the three little rivals were greeted with
enthusiasm when they stepped out of the
anteroom for the last time and took up their
positions in front of the platform. They looked
very small and slight as they stood there in
their short red frocks against a solid background
of people; but they had quite lost every
suspicion of bashfulness, and Babs even began
to look upon the whole thing as an immense
joke. She nodded gaily to the boys in the
gallery, and smiled happily at Auntie Anna,
who had the place of honour on the platform
next to the Canon; and in the silence that
followed, while Charlotte Bigley was jumping
from rung to rung of the horizontal ladder, she
occupied herself in trying to decide on her own
exercise. If Jean chose leaving go with one
hand, she should swing and let go and catch on
to the trapeze beyond&#8211;at least, if Hurly-Burly
would only be decent and give her leave. She
half hoped that Jean <i>would</i> choose the other;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
for she had practised the trapeze one, only last
week, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>A sudden murmur, followed by a faint
attempt at applause, roused her; and she saw
Charlotte Bigley walking slowly back to the
anteroom with her eyes fixed on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8216;What happened? I didn&#8217;t see,&#8217; she
whispered, nudging Jean.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hand slipped, fell off,&#8217; answered Jean,
briefly, as she went forward and grasped the
rings.</p>

<p>She did choose swinging and letting go with
one hand, and she went through it very successfully,
and earned every bit of the applause that
greeted her when she finished. Barbara was
so delighted that she went on clapping her
loudly after everybody else had stopped, and
did not notice what she was doing till the
audience began to laugh and Hurly-Burly came
up and spoke to her.</p>

<p>&#8216;May I have the trapeze let down?&#8217; whispered
Babs, eagerly. &#8216;I want to let go of the rings
and catch on to it at the end of my swing&#8211;like
I did the other day.&#8217;</p>

<p>Hurly-Burly looked doubtful. &#8216;Are you
sure you can manage it?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>Barbara pleaded, and the games-mistress
gave in. It was always difficult for any one so
practical as Miss Burleigh to understand the
odd little pupil, who at one moment could throw
herself into a game as heartily as a boy, and at
another was liable to exasperate her companions
by going off into a dream and completely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
forgetting what she was doing. But it was impossible
to help liking the child, and Hurly-Burly,
who had a sneaking conviction that the
trapeze exercise would decide the prize in her
favour, could not resist the temptation to let
her have her own way and secure to herself at
the same time a little reflected glory. For it
was she who had taught Barbara the exercise,
and she had every reason to be proud of her
pupil. So she let down the trapeze from the
roof and held it back with her hands, ready to
drop it forward when the child had worked up
her swing.</p>

<p>The eyes of the German music-master were
filled with sentimental interest, as the youngest
girl in the school stepped up to the rings. He
knew very little about gymnastics, though a
German; for his life had been passed almost
entirely in other lands, and during the brief
period he had spent in his own country he had
been so absorbed in his art that he had completely
neglected the physical culture that is of
so much importance to most Germans. As for
girls&#8217; gymnastics, his experience in them had
been entirely confined to a few occasions like
the present, when he was asked to play instead
of the junior music-mistress. But he never
assisted at the usual lessons, when the junior
music-mistress was considered good enough to
perform; so Miss Finlayson&#8217;s remarks on the
merits of the three competitors conveyed very
little to him. Still, he managed to gather that
Barbara stood a good chance of winning the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
prize, and his fat, benevolent face beamed with
satisfaction in consequence. It was true that
the little Frulein with the black, black eyes
and the wonder-clumsy fingers had no more
talent for music than his tabby cat, while the
performances of Frulein Vilkins were the joy
of his heart; but it was the little one who
asked him so many questions about his beloved
Germany, which she seemed to regard as being
about the size of Kensington Gardens, and he
forgave her all her excruciating false notes for
the sake of her warm heart, which was <i>colossal</i>.
When he saw her standing there all alone, he
quite gave up trying to be brilliant and dropped
into a little simple melody of his own, which he
had never thought important enough to name,
but which Barbara had always told him in her
funny English was &#8216;awfully fine.&#8217; Unfortunately,
just as she recognised the notes and
nodded at him with a little smile, Jean brought
him a message from the games-mistress, asking
him not to play at all until the exercise was over.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s rather a difficult exercise, and you
might put her out,&#8217; explained Jean, seeing that
he looked puzzled at such a peculiar request.
Her explanation did not help him much, for
Jean did not trouble to translate it into his own
language; and, never having witnessed the
exercise that was coming, he failed to see the
point of Hurly-Burly&#8217;s message. However, he
was glad of the opportunity to descend from
the platform and get a better view of the little
Frulein&#8217;s performance; and he placed himself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
rather inconveniently, just in front of the games-mistress,
and prepared to miss nothing of what
followed.</p>

<p>Everybody in the room was smiling genially
at the youngest girl in the school. She had
already prepossessed them in her favour by her
frank admiration for Jean Murray; and now,
as she stood there waiting for the sign from
Hurly-Burly to begin, there was something
about her happy unconsciousness that appealed
irresistibly to her audience. Suddenly, the five
boys in the gallery began to stamp their feet
encouragingly, and Peter shouted &#8216;Go it, Babe!&#8217;
at the top of his voice. In a moment, the cry
was taken up in the anteroom. &#8216;Go it, Babe!&#8217;
said twenty voices or more in a breath. The
enthusiasm was infectious, and the words were
repeated with many a laugh all over the room.
&#8216;Go it, Babe!&#8217; cried the people on the platform,
and the people in the gallery, and the people
who sat near her by the wall, until every one
in the gymnasium was stamping and clapping
and saying &#8216;Go it, Babe!&#8217; to the little person
in the short scarlet frock.</p>

<p>Barbara held the rings tightly, and her breath
came rather quickly and unevenly. She was
bewildered by the noise, and waited for it to
subside before she began the exercise. It was
so difficult to know what it all meant. Of
course, the boys wanted her to win; and perhaps
the other people did too, because they were
grown up, and grown-up people always were
jolly and kind to her. She could understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
why the Doctor, stern as he was, smiled away
at her and clapped her as heartily as any one,
from his place on the platform; and she thought
she knew dimly what was making Jean stamp
on the floor till the dust flew. But the enthusiasm
of her other school-fellows, who were
pressing forward from the anteroom door,
amazed her greatly. Could it be that they had
suddenly forgotten how young and unimportant
she was, and how much she needed correction,
and how often she required to be told that she
was the youngest in the school? Were these
the girls she had hated so heartily only three
months ago, the disgraced princesses she had
turned out of her kingdom so passionately?</p>

<p>The applause died down at last, and Miss
Burleigh made her the signal to begin. Babs
walked back as far as she could, stood stretched
for a second on the tips of her toes, then shook
the hair out of her eyes with the old familiar
movement, and took a sharp run forward. The
next minute, the slim scarlet form was flying
backwards and forwards, with graceful, regular
movements. The onlookers gazed and admired,
wondering with some curiosity what her exercise
was going to be; and their interest increased
when she uttered a sharp &#8216;Now!&#8217; just as she
was sweeping backwards from her highest swing.
Only one person in the room failed to notice
that it was Miss Burleigh who let the trapeze
drop forward instantly, so that it hung ready
for the small performer to grasp on her return
swing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>The music-master had been wholly absorbed
in watching the little Frulein, from the first
moment she had begun to swing. He thought
he had never seen anything so graceful as the
way she swept to and fro, nor anything so
<i>hbsch</i> as the expression and the rose-red complexion
of the youngest girl in the school. It
was truly <i>grossartig</i>! His eyes followed her
closely all the time, from end to end of her
swing; and that was how he contrived to be
looking away at the precise moment when
Hurly-Burly let down the trapeze. The murmur
that rose from the people who surrounded him,
as they realised what Barbara was going to do,
made him look round; and he saw the thing
hanging there, as though it had dropped from
the roof by accident, and in another second
would get in the way of the child who was
swinging so deliciously. Viewed afterwards in
the light of ordinary common-sense, it seemed
to him <i>wunderbar</i> that he could so have deceived
himself. At the time, not a doubt was in his
mind as to what he thought had happened.
The trapeze had fallen down by accident and
was going to embarrass the little Frulein, if
not to hurt her; and the people around him
were all exclaiming aloud, because they too
had realised her danger. Nevertheless, nobody
seemed to know what to do, and the little
Frulein was already sweeping straight towards
it on her downward swing. All these reflections
rushed through his brain in the flash of a
moment. There was no time to hesitate. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
must be the one to rush out and come to her
aid. With a loud German exclamation, the
music-master hurled himself forward and
snatched back the trapeze just as the child
let go of the rings.</p>

<p>He had a dim recollection afterwards of being
gripped by Hurly-Burly just an instant too late,
and of seeing the little scarlet figure twist in
the air above him and drop with a nasty thud
at the edge of the last mattress, of finding himself
in the midst of a huge concourse of people,
who suddenly rose up with a great roar and
bore down upon him, uttering shriek after
shriek,&#8211;and then, of coming miserably to himself
again, with his heart thumping and his head
throbbing painfully, just as a deathlike silence
succeeded the uproar, and a voice like Miss
Finlayson&#8217;s said something that sounded like
&#8216;Doctor!&#8217;</p>

<p>Some one had sprung from the platform
with a flying jump the moment the accident
happened, and was forcing a passage through
the throng of people. There was not a sound
to be heard in the great gymnasium as the
Doctor knelt down on the floor and put out his
hand to the little still spot of scarlet that lay
on the edge of the last mattress.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LAST DAY OF THE TERM</span></h2>

<p>In the annals of Wootton Beeches there had
never been so dismal a packing-day as the one
that dawned on the morrow of the gymnastic
competition. Generally, packing-day was the
most delightful day in the term: it came just
after the break-up party, and just before going
home, and everything that happened on it
seemed filled with a peculiar interest of its own.
First of all, there was the joy of rushing up to
the bedrooms directly after breakfast, to put
out all the clothes in tidy little heaps, ready for
packing later on; then, the less delightful business
of clearing the bookshelves and tearing up
the old exercise-books&#8211;an occupation which
contrived, in spite of itself, to present a certain
amount of charm, simply because it belonged to
the last day of the term. And the nicest part
of all was the indescribable feeling that it was
the last day of the term, that there were no
more lessons to prepare and no more penalties
to avoid, no more scales to practise and no
more stockings to mend, and, best of all, no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
more rules to bother about, so that Frulein
and Mademoiselle could both be addressed,
much to their own distraction, in the British
tongue, and anybody who pleased could run up
and down stairs to her heart&#8217;s content without
asking leave first. All these privileges made
packing-day, as a rule, something to look forward
to. But to-day nothing was happening as
it usually did.</p>

<p>Breakfast had been gone through almost in
silence, and the accustomed rush to the bedrooms
afterwards had taken place quite quietly
and tamely. The tidying of the bookshelves,
which could generally be made to linger so
pleasantly over the whole morning, was accomplished
for once in an hour or so; and the girls
found themselves, at eleven o&#8217;clock, with nothing
further to do until Miss Tomlinson should
send for them to pack their things. On any
other packing-day the playroom would have
been cleared of chairs and tables in a few
minutes, and somebody would have been
dragged to the piano to play a valse, and there
would have been plenty of amusement for every
one until dinner-time. But to-day nobody
wanted to dance, and hardly any one talked.</p>

<p>Jean Murray sat motionless on one of the
window-seats in the senior playroom. On
packing-day all ordinary restrictions were suspended,
and the younger children wandered
in and out of the two rooms as they pleased.
Jean had taken advantage of this privilege to
escape from her usual play-fellows, who were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
remaining behind from force of habit in their
own domain. The way Angela persisted in
crying was enough to drive any one away; she
had cried all through prayers, and had begun
again directly after breakfast. Mary Wells,
forgetting how much she had endured on former
occasions from the triumvirate, sat with her
arm round Angela&#8217;s neck, calling her &#8216;Poor
darling!&#8217; at intervals, with an occasional sob of
her own to keep her company. Some of the
others cried a little too,&#8211;at least, they did when
they came near Angela,&#8211;and Charlotte Bigley
was in such a temper that no one dared speak
to her. All together, the juniors&#8217; room was more
than Jean could bear just then. Jean was not
crying herself: she had not cried a drop since
she saw the streak of scarlet twist round in the
air and drop with a thud that still sounded in
her ears.</p>

<p>It was not a bit like the last day of the term.
&#8216;Tommy&#8217; did not once come to the door and
call out the name of the next girl who was to
go upstairs and pack. Nobody in the room
was exchanging addresses with any one else,
or promising to write weekly letters during the
holidays. Margaret was as cross as Charlotte
Bigley, it seemed, for she allowed no one but
Ruth Oliver to come near her; and the other
big girls were scattered about the room in idle,
listless groups, conversing a little, now and
then, in hushed tones. None of them noticed
Jean; and Jean never saw them. She just sat
rigidly on the window-seat, and looked straight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
in front of her, with the odd, hard expression
on her face that had been there since the night
before.</p>

<p>Margaret was sitting at the table tracing
interminable circles on the back of an old envelope
with a pair of compasses. The presence
of Ruth at her elbow, as she absorbed herself
in this pursuit, was very comforting. Ruth was
a slow old thing, as every one knew, but in
time of need she was invaluable.</p>

<p>After a while, the head girl dug the point of
the compass into the table, and cleared her
throat nervously.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s such an awfully nice little kid,&#8217; she
said. She spoke hurriedly, and her face had
turned rather red.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; answered Ruth, staring down at the
maze of circles on the back of the envelope.</p>

<p>Margaret went on, with an effort: &#8216;She
has such a queer way of getting at you,&#8217; she
said. &#8216;I never knew how much I cared about
the child, till&#8211;till now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; answered Ruth, softly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Supposing<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217; began Margaret, and
stopped abruptly. &#8216;Do you think<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>?&#8217; she
began again, and again hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hurly-Burly said they couldn&#8217;t tell till the
Doctor&#8217;s next visit,&#8217; replied Ruth. &#8216;She hadn&#8217;t
recovered consciousness when he left, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t!&#8217; muttered Margaret, hastily. She
dug the compass a little deeper, and cleared
her throat once more. &#8216;When did you see
Hurly-Burly?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>&#8216;Just after prayers,&#8217; said Ruth. &#8216;She said I
wasn&#8217;t to tell the younger ones, so don&#8217;t split.
The Doctor stayed till five this morning, and
he&#8217;s coming again presently. He&#8217;s rather cut
up, she says.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>That</i> Doctor? Don&#8217;t believe it!&#8217; said Margaret,
shading some of the circles with a
pencil.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hurly-Burly said so,&#8217; maintained Ruth, in
her resolute way. &#8216;Perhaps he isn&#8217;t so stiff
and stupid as he seems. I saw him last
night, talking to Jill Urquhart, and he looked
quite young and jolly. You never know, do
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Perhaps not. It doesn&#8217;t matter, does it?&#8217;
said the head girl, indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hurly-Burly is pretty bad, too,&#8217; continued
Ruth. &#8216;She thinks it&#8217;s her fault, because there
was a gap in the mattresses, so that the Babe
fell half on the boards. That&#8217;s how she cut her
head. You see, the mattresses were arranged
for the rings, and when Hurly-Burly altered
them for the trapeze she didn&#8217;t stop to test them
to see if they were in the right place. Anybody
else might have done the same, with the whole
room waiting for her; but still, she is reproaching
herself like anything.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She needn&#8217;t,&#8217; said Margaret, with quiet
vehemence. &#8216;It&#8217;s only the fault of that idiot
Scales.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Poor Scales!&#8217; murmured Ruth. &#8216;I saw
him too wandering about the hall; and he was
crying just like a baby, and he didn&#8217;t seem to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
mind my seeing him a bit. I suppose foreigners
are always like that.&#8217;</p>

<p>Margaret curled her lip contemptuously.
&#8216;I shouldn&#8217;t waste my pity on him, if I were
you,&#8217; she remarked. &#8216;No one but a foreigner
would have anything to cry about.&#8217;</p>

<p>Ruth glanced at her timidly. &#8216;I think,
perhaps, it is worse for Scales than any one,&#8217;
she ventured to say. &#8216;Of course, he&#8217;s a hopeless
idiot, but he didn&#8217;t mean<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, never mind about Scales!&#8217; interrupted
Margaret; and Ruth took up the compasses
and began drawing invisible circles on the
tablecloth.</p>

<p>A bit of conversation drifted across to them
from the juniors&#8217; room.</p>

<p>&#8216;Her brothers stopped all night; so did the
old lady,&#8217; Mary Wells was saying. &#8216;I saw
their breakfast going into Finny&#8217;s study this
morning, when Tommy called me back into the
dining-room to fold my table-napkin.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How could you notice a thing like that?&#8217;
came in plaintive, reproving tones from Angela.
&#8216;I wish I was able to bear up like you, Mary.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Poor darling!&#8217; said Mary Wells, tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Was Jill there too?&#8217; asked another voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s up in Finny&#8217;s bedroom, with <i>her</i>,&#8217;
answered Angela, quickly. She was almost
restored to a normal condition by the desire to
tell something that nobody else knew. Then
she remembered herself, and subsided into a
proper state of tearfulness. &#8216;I was hanging
about upstairs, to see if I could find out how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
<i>she</i> was, when Jill passed me in a white apron,
looking just like a real nurse,&#8217; she went on,
with a long-drawn sigh. &#8216;I tried to speak to
her, but I was too upset.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Poor</i> darling!&#8217; cried Mary Wells, more
fervently than before.</p>

<p>Margaret stirred impatiently, and flung down
her pencil. &#8216;I say,&#8217; she said to Ruth, &#8216;what
can we give those children to do? I&#8217;m sure
Finny wouldn&#8217;t like them to go on drivelling
like that. Angela is such a little idiot!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I think she&#8217;s really fond of the Babe,&#8217;
observed Ruth, as she followed the head girl
across the room.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, yes,&#8217; admitted Margaret, with a shrug of
her shoulders; &#8216;Jean told her she&#8217;d got to be.&#8217;</p>

<p>At the window-seat she stopped and forgot
Angela for the moment. The sight of the child
who sat there, looking so white and wretched,
touched her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Cheer up, kiddie!&#8217; she said, sitting down
beside her. Ruth Oliver discreetly moved on.</p>

<p>&#8216;Get away!&#8217; gasped Jean.</p>

<p>Margaret stroked her hand, but Jean drew
it away sharply, and shifted her position so
that she looked out of the window. Her eyes
wandered across the drive and fell on the little
building in the field, where she and Angela had
passed their eight days of quarantine with the
youngest girl in the school. Somehow, Jean
could not bear the sight of it to-day, and she
moved round restively, till she faced Margaret
again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>&#8216;Oh, do leave me alone!&#8217; she said fiercely;
and the head girl felt rather helpless, and left
her.</p>

<p>In the junior playroom, Angela had relapsed
at the sight of Ruth Oliver into a fresh fit of
crying.</p>

<p>&#8216;What <i>is</i> the matter, Angela?&#8217; demanded
Ruth, for once almost losing her patience.</p>

<p>&#8216;Matter?&#8217; sobbed Angela, leaning back for
support on the substantial arm of Mary Wells.
&#8216;I&#8217;m full of re&#8211;remorse, and&#8211;and penitence!
So would you be, if&#8211;if you were as bad and&#8211;and
as sinful as me!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, what have you been doing now?&#8217;
inquired Ruth, keeping her temper with
difficulty.</p>

<p>Angela stuffed her handkerchief into her
mouth, and recovered sufficient control over
herself to take it out again and make her
confession.</p>

<p>&#8216;Last week,&#8217; she faltered, &#8216;<i>she</i> asked me to
help her with her French; and&#8211;and&#8211;I was
cross, and&#8211;and&#8211;I wouldn&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

<p>She burst into tears again, as Charlotte Bigley
looked up from the book she was pretending
to read and put in a curt remark.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s <i>she</i>?&#8217; she demanded bluntly.</p>

<p>Angela stopped crying to stare at her.
&#8216;You know fast enough, Charlotte!&#8217; she
mumbled indistinctly.</p>

<p>Charlotte tossed her head scornfully. &#8216;If
you mean Barbara Berkeley, why on earth can&#8217;t
you say so?&#8217; she exclaimed. &#8216;She hasn&#8217;t lost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
her name because she fell off the rings, <i>has</i>
she?&#8217;</p>

<p>Mary Wells spoke her mind solemnly. &#8216;We
all know <i>you</i> have no feeling, Charlotte Bigley,&#8217;
she was beginning, when some one near the
window announced that the Doctor had just
driven round the corner of the house.</p>

<p>This in itself was enough to reduce Angela
to further depths of contrition. &#8216;What shall I
do,&#8217; she wailed, &#8216;if she dies before I can ask
her forgiveness?&#8217;</p>

<p>Margaret Hulme suddenly stood over her,
and shook her by the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Stop it, child!&#8217; she said, not unkindly, for
even Angela&#8217;s tears made her own feel uncomfortably
near the surface. She turned to the
others quickly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Every one will get ready and go into the
field for a hockey practice,&#8217; she commanded.</p>

<p>Charlotte shut her book with a bang.
&#8216;What&#8217;s the good of hockey?&#8217; she grumbled
crossly.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the good of anything,&#8217; sighed Margaret,
&#8216;with that poor little kid lying ill up
there?&#8217;</p>

<p>Charlotte looked at her swiftly, and then
turned away, blinking her eyes furiously; and
the head girl took her arm with astonishing
condescension, and walked silently into the
cloakroom with her.</p>

<p>A little later, Dr. Hurst came out of Miss
Finlayson&#8217;s bedroom upstairs, and closed the
door softly behind him. The head-mistress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
stood waiting for him on the landing. Their
eyes met, and hers were full of anxious inquiry.
In his there shone a gleam of something that
had not been there before.</p>

<p>&#8216;Better,&#8217; he said, and drew a long breath.
He put his hand on the baluster-rail to steady
himself. &#8216;She&#8217;ll do, now that consciousness
has returned,&#8217; he went on in a businesslike
tone; &#8216;the concussion was only slight, after all,
and the fracture to the leg could hardly be in a
better place. Wonderful what children will do
to kill themselves without succeeding! She&#8217;ll
pull through in no time, with rest and quiet&#8211;perfect
quiet, mind! Don&#8217;t let those boys go
near her, whatever you do; and keep your girls
from weeping on her neck as much as possible.
Good morning.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson smiled, and retained his
hand a moment. No one would have thought
that this practical man of medicine, who pretended
to regard his little patient merely as an
interesting case, was the boyish-hearted fellow
who had sat by her bedside all night to watch
for her returning consciousness.</p>

<p>&#8216;Must you go?&#8217; she said. &#8216;Why not rest
on the sofa in my study for an hour, and stay
to lunch with us? You must be worn out.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Doctor drew himself up and frowned.
&#8216;Not at all, not at all!&#8217; he said, looking vexed.
&#8216;Room full of patients waiting for me at home&#8211;I
must wish you good morning.&#8217;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i7'></a><img src='images/illus-260.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8216;Tell me, Herr Doktor, haf I kilt her?&#8217;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>He left her and hurried off, still frowning.
Just as he turned the corner of the gallery,
Egbert and Peter, who had been lying in wait
for him some fifteen minutes, sprang out upon
him from an open door.</p>

<p>&#8216;How is she?&#8217; they asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Really!&#8217; fumed the Doctor, who hated being
taken by surprise. &#8216;The bulletin is with Miss
Finlayson; I have no time<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>Peter grasped his arm as he was escaping.
&#8216;Is she going to get better?&#8217; he implored.
There was no mistaking the earnestness in the
boy&#8217;s face, and the Doctor melted in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, yes, to be sure,&#8217; he growled. &#8216;That
is, if you leave her alone.&#8217;</p>

<p>When he reached the staircase he was
again brought to a standstill. The way was
entirely blocked by the massive form of the
German music-master, who sat on the top stair
with his face buried in his large, fat hands.
The Doctor tapped his foot on the ground impatiently.
If one thing more than another
annoyed him, it was the sight of uncontrolled
emotion.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pardon me,&#8217; he said briskly, &#8216;but will you
kindly<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Gott in Himmel!</i>&#8217; shouted Herr Scales,
springing to his feet as he recognised the
Doctor&#8217;s voice. &#8216;Tell me, Herr Doktor, haf I
kilt her? Am I a murterer of the <i>lieblichste</i>
little Frulein that ever walked upon<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nonsense, sir!&#8217; interrupted Dr. Hurst,
doing his best to keep his temper. The sight
of the tears that streamed down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
good-natured face of the music-master was enough,
he told himself, to annoy any man who was not
a foreigner. &#8216;Nobody has killed her yet; but
what you are going to do, among you, before
you have done with her, I shouldn&#8217;t like to say.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You do not understand,&#8217; wept Herr Scales,
clasping his hands. &#8216;It was I who nearly kilt
her, <i>dummer</i> wretch that I am.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, you haven&#8217;t killed her, my good sir,
and she&#8217;s going to get better,&#8217; answered the
Doctor, trying to deal gently with him in spite
of his irritating foreign behaviour. Then he
left him and went quickly down the stairs.</p>

<p>Two more voices assailed him in the hall, as
he took down his coat from the peg. Restraining
his impatience as best he might, the young
man looked round to find Kit and Wilfred at
his elbow. Curled up on the rug in front of
the stove lay Robin, fast asleep, with his head
pillowed on a footstool. Weariness and the
shedding of many tears had left their mark on
his round, babyish face, and the elder boys
looked little more than half-awake themselves.
Kit&#8217;s face was tear-stained too, and he suddenly
found he could not put the question he was
longing to ask. It was Wilfred who blurted
it out instead.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is she better?&#8217; he asked.</p>

<p>The Doctor had been up all night; he had
gone through more anxiety than he could have
believed himself capable of feeling; he had
found that his heart had gone out unconsciously,
eleven weeks ago, to the child who had called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
him a beast; and he felt that all the glory his
profession could bring him was not worth so
much as the saving of that one little life upstairs.
And then people came and bothered him
with their senseless questions. If she were
worse, was it likely he would be leaving her now?</p>

<p>He was worn out with want of sleep, and it
did not occur to him that the same thing might
possibly be true of the white-faced lads before
him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bless my soul!&#8217; he exclaimed testily.
&#8216;How many <i>are</i> there of you? There&#8217;s a
couple at every corner. How can you expect
your sister to get better if you hang about the
place and ask questions at the top of your
voice? There&#8217;s&#8211;there&#8217;s an atmosphere of
nervous sentiment all over the house that&#8217;s
enough to ruin any case.&#8217;</p>

<p>Wilfred was dumbfounded, and stared stupidly.
But Christopher suddenly found his
tongue, and, being Christopher, he found it
sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#8216;Counting Jill, there are only six all together,&#8217;
he said, peering up at the irritated young man
through his spectacles, &#8216;so you won&#8217;t meet any
more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t care how many there are of you,&#8217;
grumbled Dr. Hurst, flinging on his coat.
&#8216;Keep out of her way, that&#8217;s all&#8211;and mine
too.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You may be sure we&#8217;ll do that, if we can,&#8217;
retorted Wilfred, recovering his courage.
&#8216;Only, you haven&#8217;t told us yet how she is.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>&#8216;You seem to forget she&#8217;s our sister, and
we&#8217;re beastly cut up about her,&#8217; added Kit,
glumly.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s not a rotten bacteria, either,&#8217; said
Wilfred, in a vicious undertone which the
Doctor fortunately missed.</p>

<p>Dr. Hurst felt a little bit ashamed of himself,
and was more cross than ever. &#8216;There, there!
She&#8217;s better, of course,&#8217; he muttered, pushing
past his questioners. Then he saw the sleeping
Robin curled up in front of the stove, and he
glanced back at the tired faces of the other two.
&#8216;Best thing you can do is to go straight to bed,&#8217;
he advised, jamming his hat down on his head.
&#8216;Best thing for the case, too.&#8217;</p>

<p>Kit smiled at him indulgently. &#8216;Let them
go to bed who have beds,&#8217; he remarked. &#8216;I&#8217;ve
only got an arm-chair.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Doctor fled discomfited, and shut the
front door in their faces. He did not understand
boys, and he did not like them, and he
would not have minded if he had never had to
meet another boy as long as he lived. In a
very few moments, however, he came to the
conclusion that although boys were pretty bad,
girls could beat them easily, with several points
to spare.</p>

<p>His man was walking the cob up and down
outside, and the trap was not in sight when
Dr. Hurst shut the front door behind him.
The occurrence was particularly unfortunate,
for as he stood waiting on the steps the whole
of the junior hockey team came strolling round
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
the corner of the house. This in itself was
sufficiently embarrassing to the young man who
stood there; and he hailed the appearance of
his trap with deep and earnest satisfaction.
But he was not to be allowed to escape so
easily. The sound of wheels made the children
look round; and some one suddenly called out&#8211;&#8216;It&#8217;s
the Doctor!&#8217; The next moment he
found himself, greatly to his consternation, in
the middle of a throng of excited young ladies,
all in extremely short skirts and all armed with
hockey clubs, who were clamouring loudly and
persistently to know if Barbara Berkeley was
out of danger.</p>

<p>Probably it would never have happened if
it had not been the last day of the term, when
a sense of unusual liberty prevailed. Certainly,
if it had been any other day the hockey team
would not have been wandering round by the
front door at all, but would have gone straight
to the nine-acre field through the orchard at
the back. But the Doctor knew nothing of all
this. He only realised that the girls were
finishing what the boys had begun, and that in
another minute he should lose his temper very
badly indeed.</p>

<p>Most eager of all was a child with a freckled
face and reddish-coloured hair, who somehow
seemed familiar to him, though he could not
remember where he had met her before. She
came right up to where he stood helplessly, with
his right foot placed on the carriage-step; and
she raised her voice shrilly above all the others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>&#8216;May I see her before she gets worse?&#8217; she
implored sentimentally. &#8216;I should never forgive
myself, Mary Wells says I shouldn&#8217;t, if
anything happened to her, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>The Doctor made a great effort and waved
them off distractedly, just as Margaret Hulme
and some of the elder ones hurried on the scene
and called angrily to his tormentors. He seized
the opportunity to spring to his seat, and then
turned and glared at them.</p>

<p>&#8216;See her before she gets worse?&#8217; he
answered back furiously. &#8216;If you want to see
her before you&#8217;ve done your best to finish her
altogether, you&#8217;ll have to look sharp.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Finlayson suddenly appeared on the
doorstep. Nobody knew how much she had
seen or heard, but she was looking exceedingly
stern. She opened her mouth to speak, just as
Dr. Hurst perceived her and broke into a fresh
torrent of words. By this time he had lost the
last scrap of his patience.</p>

<p>&#8216;What with rascally boys and hysterical
<i>schoolgirls</i>,&#8217; he shouted, seizing the whip and
cracking it round his head, &#8216;how can you expect
me to pull the case through?&#8217;</p>

<p>He tugged violently at the reins; the
startled animal sprang forward, and the trap
clattered noisily out of sight.</p>

<p>The few short, vigorous sentences with
which Miss Finlayson improved the next five
minutes sent the girls into the hockey field
with a much reduced opinion of themselves.
Margaret Hulme stayed behind to vindicate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
the offenders as well as she could; and the
result was that the head-mistress remembered
it was the last day of the term, and blamed
herself for having almost allowed her feelings
for the youngest girl in school to run away
with her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Send Jean and Angela up to my bedroom
at once,&#8217; she said thoughtfully, when Margaret
had finished telling her what had been going
on in the playroom that morning.</p>

<p>She waited for them on the landing, and
kissed them both very affectionately when they
appeared hand in hand. She glanced quickly
from Angela&#8217;s red and swollen countenance to
Jean&#8217;s pale and miserable one, and she decided
not to say what had been in her mind the
minute before. A much better idea struck her,
and she acted upon it promptly.</p>

<p>&#8216;If you will promise me to be as quiet as
mice,&#8217; she whispered, &#8216;you shall both have one
peep at her.&#8217;</p>

<p>The room into which she led them on tiptoe
was almost dark. The only light that was
admitted came from one small window in the
farther corner, and it was just enough to reveal
Jill, as she bent over the bed with a cup in her
hand. Then she moved away, and the two
children, peeping from their hiding-place behind
the screen by the door, saw Barbara.</p>

<p>She lay flat on her back among the white
pillows; a hillock under the bedclothes showed
where the cage protected her broken leg, and a
bandage round her head kept the thick, dark
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
hair from tumbling over her face as it usually
did. Otherwise, she was not nearly so much
altered as her play-fellows had vaguely expected
to find her. The bright little eyes gleamed out
as impishly as ever from beneath the white
bandage, and as she smiled up at Jill they
realised to their intense relief that the Babe,
with a hole in her head and a cage over her
leg, was much the same Babe who had arrived
in their midst, with her elf-like look and her
happy unconscious smile, three months ago.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, Jean, I do believe you&#8217;re crying,&#8217; said
Angela, in surprise, when Miss Finlayson had
pushed them outside again, and they were
retreating slowly along the gallery. Angela
herself felt no further inclination to cry, now
that she had seen the Babe and found she was
not a bit altered. There was no middle course
in Angela&#8217;s emotions, and her only wonder now
was why any one had made a fuss about
Barbara&#8217;s accident at all.</p>

<p>But the tears were raining down Jean&#8217;s
cheeks for the first time, and the hard, queer
look was gone from her face. She flung herself
away to her own room, and left Angela to

<p>&#8216;Have the girls gone home?&#8217; asked the
invalid, about a week later. She had made
such strides towards recovery that she was to
be allowed her first visitor that day, and she
could not help wondering whether Jean Murray
was going to be the privileged person. Everything
had been so strange and quiet since the
morning she had woke up in Finny&#8217;s bed; and
she had slept away so many hours of the days
that followed, that she had lost count of the
time altogether. She seemed to have been
lying in a kind of delicious enchantment, with
people doing things for her just as though she
were a princess; while Jill was always at hand
to tell her stories in her beautiful soft voice,
whenever she grew tired of lying still. For
Jill was the nicest person in the world to be
with, when one was enchanted; she never
bothered, and she always seemed to come to
the rescue just in time, when the pain of being
strapped in one position began to grow intolerable.
Then, there was the Doctor too.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
No one would have expected the Doctor to
turn out such a trump. Only to-day, after
being so strict in the morning about what she
was to eat, he had run in again after lunch to
bring her a packet of sweets. They were very
wholesome sweets, as he had assured Jill; but
still they were sweets, and a doctor who was a
beast would never have thought of bringing
them, even if they were wholesome. So,
clearly, he was not a beast. Even Jill had
been surprised at his coming twice in one day,
now that she was so much better; so that
showed that he must be a particularly nice sort
of doctor. For Jill had once nursed Auntie
Anna when she was ill, and she knew a lot
about doctors, so she would not have been
surprised at his coming twice in one day, if it
had been a usual thing for a doctor to do.
Babs smiled happily to herself as she settled
the Doctor&#8217;s claims to niceness; then she remembered
that she was going to have a visitor
after tea, and she asked again if the girls had
gone home.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, they went five or six days ago,&#8217; said
Jill, without impatience, though she had
answered the same question once already.
Babs certainly did not need an illness to make
her absent-minded.</p>

<p>&#8216;Then who is coming to see me after tea?&#8217;
was Barbara&#8217;s next inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8216;I said Kit might come; I thought you
would like to have him best,&#8217; answered
Jill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>&#8216;Kit? Is he going to bicycle over from
Crofts?&#8217; asked the child.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, no,&#8217; explained Jill, smiling. &#8216;They
have all been in the house ever since you were
taken ill. Finny invited them to stay, you
know, and Auntie Anna too.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara laughed a little. &#8216;They&#8217;ll never be
able to tease me again, now that they&#8217;ve stopped
in a girl&#8217;s school themselves,&#8217; she remarked
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>There was a pause, which the invalid
occupied in thinking over the things she had
been too lazy to consider before. She had a
great many questions to ask, but somehow it
was too much exertion to ask them. Fortunately,
Jill was so clever that she always guessed
what she wanted to know without waiting to be
asked first; and that saved a lot of trouble.
In this way the child had learned that the
gymnastic prize was to be divided between
Jean and herself; and thinking about the
gymnastic prize produced another question
from her, rather unexpectedly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Wasn&#8217;t it Scales who moved the trapeze
away?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>Jill looked up surprised. None of them
knew how much Babs remembered of what
had happened on the night of her accident.
&#8216;Yes,&#8217; she replied. &#8216;He has been very unhappy
about it, poor man! He writes every
day from Hanover to say how miserable he is.
But, of course, it was an accident.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course,&#8217; said Barbara, looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
distressed; and Jill was afraid she had said too
much.</p>

<p>&#8216;Shall I write and send him a message from
you?&#8217; she suggested quickly. Babs brightened
up, and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8216;Tell him it&#8217;s awfully jolly to be ill and to
have every one doing things for you, and
bringing you sweets, and all that,&#8217; she said
eagerly. &#8216;And say that if he wants me to pay
him out, just to make us quits, don&#8217;t you know,
he can think of the awful way I am sure to
play my pieces next term.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very well,&#8217; answered Jill, laughing; and
there was silence once more.</p>

<p>Jill looked very pretty as she sat there by
the window, working away at her embroidery
in the frame; and Babs congratulated herself,
with a glow of satisfaction, on having made her
a princess in her fairy kingdom. It was so
nice of Jill, she reflected, to behave exactly like
a princess, and to sit at the window of her
lonely turret making tapestry, to while away
the time until her prince should come thundering
over the drawbridge below. Jill&#8217;s prince
had not come yet, so of course she would have
to go on working by the window till he did;
she deserved an extra nice prince too, and
Babs sighed as she remembered that she had
not been able to find her any sort of a prince
so far.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a pity, isn&#8217;t it, that Dr. Hurst had to
be enchanted again so soon?&#8217; she murmured
aloud.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>&#8216;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t <i>quite</i> understand,&#8217; said
the princess, from the window.</p>

<p>&#8216;You see,&#8217; continued Babs, solemnly, &#8216;he
began by being a beast; then I disenchanted
him and made him into a handsome and gallant
young prince; and after that he was so horrid
to Jean and Angela in the quarantine that I
had to turn him out of my kingdom, and make
him wander over the earth once more in the
shape of a beast.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh,&#8217; said Jill, bending rather closely over
the embroidery frame. &#8216;Let me see, what
kingdom was that?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>My</i> kingdom,&#8217; answered Barbara, in an
important tone. Then she realised that Jill
did not know about her kingdom. &#8216;I&#8217;ve never
told any one before,&#8217; she went on doubtfully.
&#8216;If I tell you, Jill, will you promise not to
laugh?&#8217;</p>

<p>Jill promised, and worked on steadily at her
embroidery while the small voice from the bed
painted her the fairy kingdom she had never
described to any one before.</p>

<p>&#8216;And so,&#8217; concluded Barbara, with a sigh, &#8216;I
can&#8217;t make it come right, because now there&#8217;s a
princess without a prince. Do you mind waiting
until I find you a prince, Jill?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not at all,&#8217; answered Jill, turning to the
light rather abruptly, and taking quite a long
time to choose between two shades of silk.</p>

<p>&#8216;It was so stupid of Dr. Hurst to get himself
turned out like that, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8217; continued
Babs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>&#8216;He&#8211;perhaps he didn&#8217;t know,&#8217; said Jill, with
some hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8216;You can&#8217;t be a beast without knowing it,&#8217;
answered Barbara, positively.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you sure he <i>is</i> a beast?&#8217; asked Jill,
who was still looking out of the window,
though she had chosen her silk some moments
ago.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, he&#8217;s not a beast now. I <i>love</i> him.
Don&#8217;t you?&#8217; cried the child, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Jill began putting her work away in a great
hurry. &#8216;It&#8217;s time for tea,&#8217; she remarked.</p>

<p>Barbara did not seem to have heard. The
dreamy look had returned to her face, and she
was almost thinking aloud.</p>

<p>&#8216;You see,&#8217; she murmured, &#8216;however nice he
is now, he <i>must</i> walk round the world seven
times, and kill a giant, and rescue a beautiful
princess, before he can be disenchanted a
second time. You can&#8217;t alter that. It&#8217;s a pity
you haven&#8217;t got to be rescued or anything, Jill,
because then<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If you talk any more, child,&#8217; interrupted
Jill, with decision, &#8216;you will be too tired to
have a visitor after tea.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jill <i>was</i> a nice person, Barbara settled again
in her mind, as they had tea together out of
Finny&#8217;s private tea-set that the Canon had
given her last Christmas. She was so nice
that she even slipped away afterwards, when
Christopher came into the room, so that he and
Babs could have their talk together without
feeling that somebody else was listening. For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
all that, neither of them seemed to find it easy
to begin, and they remained looking at each
other in silence for some moments after Jill
had closed the door upon them.</p>

<p>Then Christopher made a great effort and
addressed her from the end of the bed, where
he had taken up his position.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hullo!&#8217; he said, tugging at his collar as if
to remove some obstruction to his voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hullo!&#8217; answered Babs, faintly, from among
her pillows.</p>

<p>Then followed another pause. They both
felt there were plenty of things to be said, but
somehow they could not think of them just
then. Presently, Kit remembered that she
was an invalid, and that invalids always had to
be kissed. He also decided that the sooner he
got it over the better; so he marched round to
the side of the bed and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8216;How are you, Babe?&#8217; he asked, feeling
more at his ease now that this formality was
over and he was free to climb on the edge of
her bed and sit there swinging his legs.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I&#8217;m all right,&#8217; answered Barbara,
heartily.</p>

<p>They both knew she was nothing of the
sort, but in the Berkeley family it was a point
of honour with every one, even during a visitation
of toothache, to declare himself &#8216;all right.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How are you, Kit?&#8217; asked Babs, after a
little further reflection.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m all right, thanks,&#8217; answered Christopher,
faithfully, and he whistled a tune to fill the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
next pause. &#8216;Awfully poor lying here, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8217; he resumed presently.</p>

<p>Barbara nodded. &#8216;It&#8217;s stale,&#8217; she said expressively.</p>

<p>Kit looked sympathetic. &#8216;It would make
<i>me</i> sick,&#8217; he observed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s all right,&#8217; Barbara hastened to
assure him; and he whistled a little more.</p>

<p>&#8216;Jill&#8217;s all right too, isn&#8217;t she?&#8217; he continued
after a while.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Jill&#8217;s all right&#8211;<i>rather</i>,&#8217; said the child,
warmly. &#8216;How are the other boys, Kit?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;re all right,&#8217; answered Kit.</p>

<p>&#8216;And Auntie Anna?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s <i>all</i> right,&#8217; answered Kit.</p>

<p>Conversation again languished slightly. Barbara&#8217;s
eyes, wandering round the room in search
of inspiration, fell on the little bag of sweets
that the Doctor had brought her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have a sweet,&#8217; she suggested, pointing to
the table by the window.</p>

<p>Christopher slipped off the bed with alacrity.
&#8216;It&#8217;s awfully decent of you,&#8217; he observed. &#8216;Sure
you don&#8217;t want them all?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, no; take the whole jolly lot,&#8217; begged his
sister.</p>

<p>Kit&#8217;s countenance fell slightly when he
peered into the bag. &#8216;Acid drops,&#8217; he commented
briefly, and put a couple critically into
his mouth. &#8216;Who brought them?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dr. Hurst. He said they were wholesome,&#8217;
replied Babs, by way of explanation. She did
not want Kit to think she had been such a muff
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
as to choose acid drops in preference to
chocolate.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s just about what he would say,&#8217; remarked
the boy, putting several more of them
into his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8211;I think he&#8217;s all right, Kit,&#8217; said Barbara,
timidly.</p>

<p>Christopher shook his head vigorously. It
was the only form of reply possible to him at
the moment.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s a rotter,&#8217; he said, as soon as he could
speak; &#8216;and so slack, too!&#8217; He peered again
into the paper bag. &#8216;Is it worth while?&#8217; he
murmured to himself, and decided that it was
not. &#8216;Pity it wasn&#8217;t some one else who got
them for you,&#8217; he added with a sigh, as he
returned to the bed.</p>

<p>&#8216;He isn&#8217;t bad, <i>really</i>, Kit,&#8217; persisted the
child, looking troubled.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not bad? Why, he&#8217;s an awful old soft,
Babe,&#8217; answered Kit, contemptuously. &#8216;If you
were a boy, you&#8217;d know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He isn&#8217;t old, anyhow. He&#8217;s only twenty-eight;
I asked him,&#8217; said Babs, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, rats!&#8217; laughed Kit, who had quite got
over his awkwardness by this time, and was
rapidly forgetting that she was an invalid and
that he had been told not to tease her. &#8216;He
may be twenty-eight perhaps, if you just count
his birthdays, but he&#8217;s as old as the hills for all
that. He was born grown-up; that sort of
chap always is.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s been awfully kind to me, Kit,&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
persisted the child, her troubled look returning.</p>

<p>&#8216;You always think people are nicer than
they are, don&#8217;t you?&#8217; observed her brother,
with gentle scorn. &#8216;When we had that beast
of a housekeeper who used to smack you and
Robin, you always said her Sunday bonnet was
beautiful, or something like that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Kit!&#8217; was all Barbara felt capable
of replying, and the boy rattled on heedlessly.</p>

<p>&#8216;That Doctor is the rottenest of rotters,&#8217; he
declared in a cheerful tone. &#8216;He only pretends
to like you because you&#8217;re what he calls a &#8220;case.&#8221;
If you&#8217;d got asthma, now, he&#8217;d treat you as if
you were putting it all on, and make you feel
a jolly humbug. <i>I</i> know him!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course, you&#8217;re always right, Kit,&#8217; said
Babs, growing more unhappy every minute,
&#8216;but&#8211;but<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He treated us all like kids the first day
you were ill,&#8217; said Christopher, scowling at the
recollection; &#8216;and once, when Jill was blubbing
because you weren&#8217;t so well, we got in a funk
and went off on our own, Peter and I, to fetch
him; and he wouldn&#8217;t come. He said no one
could do anything for you by just coming and
looking at you, and we weren&#8217;t to disturb him
for nothing at all&#8211;or some such rot. Then we
found that he&#8217;d cooked up an arrangement
with Finny not to come unless <i>she</i> sent for
him. Just like him!&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara was struggling feebly to keep back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
her tears. She could not think what was making
her want to cry so much.</p>

<p>The boy had stopped scowling, and was
chuckling softly to himself. Barbara held her
breath, and thought that if he would only talk
about something else, she might be able to
keep from crying. Perhaps the table by the
window might stop swimming about, too.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ve scored one against him at last,
though,&#8217; her brother was saying, in a voice
that seemed suddenly to have gone a long way
off. &#8216;He must be quite at the other end of the
gallery,&#8217; Babs thought. Yet some one was
certainly sitting on the edge of her bed, because
she could feel the mattress jumping up and
down.</p>

<p>&#8216;We struck that little kid in the yard just
now&#8211;the one who nearly gave you scarlet fever,&#8217;
Christopher went on gaily. &#8216;He came to know
how you were, or something. Bobby Hearne,
I think he called himself. Well, we got him
to go to the doctor&#8217;s house with a message from
his aunt, who lives five miles t&#8217;other side of
Crofts, to say that she had just fallen downstairs
and nearly killed herself, and would he
go to her at once! Thirty miles there and
back, all for nothing! Rather a score, eh?
It was my idea, too, not Peter&#8217;s!&#8217;</p>

<p>He turned to Barbara for approval, and
found her sobbing bitterly. She had heard
every word he said, with horrible distinctness,
though his voice had come from such a long
way off. She had tried to stop him, but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
could not make a sound till she began to
cry.</p>

<p>&#8216;Babe! I say, don&#8217;t! What&#8217;s up, old girl?&#8217;
exclaimed Kit, staring at her in consternation.
At any time it was an event, to make the Babe
cry, but now that she was so ill, he felt nothing
short of a brute.</p>

<p>Jill had slipped into the room and was bending
over the excited child.</p>

<p>&#8216;Kit doesn&#8217;t understand&#8211;he doesn&#8217;t know
he&#8217;s not really a beast&#8211;he isn&#8217;t a beast, is he?&#8217;
gasped Barbara, between her sobs. &#8216;He&#8217;s
played a horrible trick on him&#8211;he&#8217;s sent him
seven times round the world; and I never
meant him really to walk seven times round
the world&#8211;you know I didn&#8217;t, Jill. It&#8217;s all
my fault for turning him out of my kingdom&#8211;if
I hadn&#8217;t turned him out of my kingdom, he
wouldn&#8217;t be wandering seven times round<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hush!&#8217; whispered Jill, and she gave Christopher
a look that sent him stumbling out
of the room in a mixture of bewilderment and
remorse. Up and down the landing he paced,
feeling desperately wicked and desperately
foolish by turns, until Jill opened the door of
the bedroom and beckoned to him. She held
a thermometer in her hand, and she paid no
attention whatever to the shamefaced inquiry
he stammered out.</p>

<p>&#8216;Send Miss Finlayson here at once, and say
I want the Doctor,&#8217; she commanded, and went
hurriedly back into the room.</p>

<p>Clearly, she was very angry with him, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
it had never seemed possible before that Jill
could be angry with any one. But it was not
this that suddenly made Kit turn cold and
funny all over as he started along the gallery
with Jill&#8217;s message. He pulled up short with
a jerk, and gave a little cry of dismay.</p>

<p>&#8216;What shall I do?&#8217; he exclaimed in a despairing
tone. &#8216;I&#8217;ve sent the Doctor fifteen
miles in the opposite direction.&#8217;</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was nearing seven o&#8217;clock and growing
dusk when Kit at last struck the high road
between four and five miles below Crofts.
It was a full ten-mile drive by the road from
Wootton Beeches, but Kit had saved over two
miles by taking the short cut across the fields.
He stopped for the first time since he had
started on his mad chase after the Doctor, and
looked panting up and down the deserted road.</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t have been much more than three-quarters
of an hour, and I bet it&#8217;s four miles,&#8217;
he muttered. The mud with which he was
splashed up to the collar showed the kind of
ground over which he had been travelling, and
the way his breath was coming and going told
how much of the four miles had been covered
at a run. Now that he had exhausted his first
impulse to rush after the Doctor and bring him
back at any cost, he began to realise what an
absurd thing he had set himself to do. Dr.
Hurst had had an hour&#8217;s start of him at least,
and even the short cut across the fields would
not make up for that. With a quick-trotting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
cob like his, he would have reached his destination
easily by this time and discovered the trick
that had been played upon him, and no effort
on Kit&#8217;s part would bring him back a moment
sooner than he would be coming of his own
accord. Besides, if it was any good going after
him, Finny would have sent her man on horseback
long before this, and he would have outdistanced
Kit in any case.</p>

<p>&#8216;If only our bicycles had been there instead
of at Crofts, I might have caught him up then,&#8217;
cried the boy, as the hopelessness of the position
dawned upon him.</p>

<p>Nothing answered him, and the road looked
more dreary than ever. A good deal of rain
had fallen that week, and the drip drip of the
trees overhead added a kind of melancholy to
everything. Christopher&#8217;s quick imagination
called up all the details of the scene he had left
behind him: the unwonted anger of his cousin,
the anxiety of Finny and Auntie Anna when
he had rushed into the drawing-room with her
message, and then their eagerness to ring the
bell and send some one for the Doctor, whom
he knew to be far away on a wild-goose chase
of his own making. He pictured with vividness
too the consternation that would be caused
in the house when Finny&#8217;s messenger returned
from his fruitless errand, and the look that
would come on Auntie Anna&#8217;s face when Peter
came in from his tramp with the other boys
and explained the trick that had been played
on the Doctor. No wonder he had hurried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
straight out of the house and struck blindly
across the fields, without stopping to reflect
whether it would be any good or not! Even
now, though he knew how little he could do, he
felt unable to remain inactive; and turning his
face in the direction of Crofts, he once more
broke into a run and hurried wildly along the
muddy, desolate road.</p>

<p>He had been running about thirty-five
minutes, only falling into a walk now and then
to recover his breath, when the sound of wheels,
coming from behind made him draw to the side
of the road. He still trudged on, however,
with his head down and his hands clenched,
and he did not even trouble to look round when
the vehicle caught him up and passed him.
The light from the lamp flashed across his face
as it rolled swiftly by; and immediately afterwards,
the trap pulled up just ahead of him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hullo! Is that Christopher Berkeley?&#8217;
said a voice from above.</p>

<p>Kit staggered, and stood speechless. It was
the Doctor&#8217;s voice; there was no doubt about
that. But how came he to be driving towards
Crofts instead of away from it? His sudden
appearance was so remarkable that the boy&#8217;s
head felt in a whirl.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8211;I thought<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217; he faltered.</p>

<p>The Doctor gave a quiet laugh, and climbed
down from his seat.</p>

<p>&#8216;You thought I was green enough for anything,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8217; he observed. &#8216;Just stand by
the animal, will you, while I get out of my coat?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>Kit obeyed mechanically. Everything had
turned so topsy-turvy all at once, that it seemed
no more extraordinary for him to be doing
meekly what the Doctor told him than it was
for the Doctor to be struggling out of his greatcoat
just as the rain was beginning to come on
again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Then&#8211;then you didn&#8217;t go to Bobby
Hearne&#8217;s aunt, after all?&#8217; he inquired stupidly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not much!&#8217; answered the Doctor, with
another short laugh. He had got his coat off
by this time, and he held it out to Christopher
peremptorily. &#8216;Put this on, and look sharp!&#8217;
he commanded.</p>

<p>&#8216;But<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217; stammered the boy, hanging back.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you want to keep me here all night?&#8217;
cried Dr. Hurst, impatiently; and as Kit still
hesitated, he wrapped the coat quickly round
him and lifted him bodily into the gig. Then
he mounted beside him, and turned the animal&#8217;s
head. The next instant, they were bowling
along towards home, at the rate of ten miles an
hour.</p>

<p>For the first five minutes they did not speak.
Then the Doctor jerked out a sharp inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8216;Aren&#8217;t you going to ask after your sister?&#8217;
he demanded.</p>

<p>Kit started. &#8216;I was afraid you&#8217;d rag me for
it,&#8217; he muttered awkwardly.</p>

<p>The Doctor flicked the horse with his whip.
&#8216;Sorry you think me such a brute,&#8217; he said
shortly. He flicked the horse again, and played
it a moment or two, as it tossed its head and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
jumped about. &#8216;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s anything
serious,&#8217; he went on. &#8216;I gave her a soothing
draught, and everything depends on the state
in which she wakes up. But I think she&#8217;ll be
all right.&#8217;</p>

<p>The relief at Kit&#8217;s heart nearly choked him.
&#8216;Did Jill tell you it was my fault?&#8217; he asked
after a while.</p>

<p>&#8216;I gathered as much,&#8217; said Dr. Hurst. &#8216;You
mustn&#8217;t excite her any more, you know, or I
won&#8217;t answer for the consequences. What was
it all about, eh?&#8217;</p>

<p>He was evidently making a gigantic effort
to be amiable, and Christopher felt he owed him
something in return. Besides, it was a kind of
relief to put the blame on himself.</p>

<p>&#8216;I said you were a rotter, and she said you
weren&#8217;t,&#8217; he jerked out; &#8216;and I said you were
only decent to her because she was an interesting
case, and she said<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All right,&#8217; said the Doctor, hastily. He
supposed truthfulness was an excellent thing in
theory, but it added another terror to boys.</p>

<p>As they neared the village Christopher summoned
up courage to ask one more question.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did you come out on purpose to bring me
back?&#8217; he inquired with an effort.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Dr. Hurst, briefly.</p>

<p>Christopher puzzled over this. &#8216;But&#8211;but
how did you know I&#8217;d gone after you?&#8217; he
asked curiously.</p>

<p>&#8216;Jill told me you&#8217;d disappeared, and I
guessed,&#8217; said Dr. Hurst. If it had not been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
so dark, Kit might have seen a smile flicker
across the serious face of his companion.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did Jill think about me, then?&#8217; cried the
boy, eagerly. &#8216;Perhaps she isn&#8217;t so wild with
me after all!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not so wild with you as you deserve, I
dare say,&#8217; remarked Dr. Hurst. &#8216;Indeed, it
was because Miss Urquhart was making such
an unnecessary fuss about you, that I promised
to come and look for you.&#8217;</p>

<p>He thought that the boy, although a boy,
would not notice the slip he had made just
before in calling his pretty cousin by her first
name; but Kit noticed fast enough. He had
not much time, however, to think about it before
they pulled up with a jerk at the back entrance
to Wootton Beeches. He began to mumble
out his thanks, while the Doctor helped him out
of the overcoat and then put it on himself; but
the young man cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you suppose I drove all those miles in
the rain, at the end of a hard day&#8217;s work, for
the sake of a scamp like you?&#8217; he growled;
and Christopher was left staring after him in
the darkness.</p>

<p>In the holidays supper was not before nine
o&#8217;clock at Wootton Beeches, so the boy had
plenty of time to make himself presentable
before the bell rang. He looked eagerly round
the drawing-room when he went into it, but
only the three elder boys were there.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where&#8217;s Jill?&#8217; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s you, is it?&#8217; observed Egbert,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
without answering him. As the eldest of the
family, he felt that he ought to administer some
sort of rebuke to Kit for the commotion he had
caused in the household. Indeed, he had said
as much to the others before the boy came in;
but there was something about Kit that would
make any one fight shy of rebuking him, when
it came to the point. So Egbert was rather
relieved than otherwise when Wilfred interrupted
him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Jill&#8217;s upstairs,&#8217; he said, looking over his
book at Kit. &#8216;She wants to be with the
Babe when she wakes up, in case she&#8217;s
excited or anything.&#8217;</p>

<p>Kit flung himself into an arm-chair and
whistled carelessly. Whatever his feelings
were in the matter, he was not going to let
the family see them. There was rather an
awkward silence, which Peter broke by remarking
that it was ten minutes to nine, upon which
Egbert said something about a clean collar and
went out of the room. There was a feeling
of relief when he had gone, Egbert having
reached the age when it was never quite possible
to say whether he was going to side
with the enemy or not.</p>

<p>&#8216;Egbert&#8217;s awfully wild with you,&#8217; observed
Peter, with smiling frankness. &#8216;He says you
ought to be kicked.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Let him do it,&#8217; grunted Kit, indifferently.
Having given the Doctor a glimpse of his
real feelings not so many minutes ago, he did
not intend to betray himself again yet awhile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>Wilfred, who had been watching him closely,
began slowly to understand. &#8216;It&#8217;s all right,
Kit,&#8217; he said good-naturedly. &#8216;Egbert never
counts! He only does it because he&#8217;s the
eldest and thinks we&#8217;ve got to be reminded
of it. Peter and I are with you!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Awfully kind of you, I&#8217;m sure,&#8217; answered
Christopher, sarcastically. All the same, he
stopped whistling and seemed inclined to come
round; and Peter hastened to put in a conciliating
word.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course, we know you didn&#8217;t mean to
make the Babe excited,&#8217; he said. &#8216;Jill says
so herself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, shut up!&#8217; said Kit, ungraciously.</p>

<p>&#8216;As for the Doctor,&#8217; continued Wilfred, &#8216;anybody
is justified in ragging <i>him</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rather,&#8217; chimed in Peter. &#8216;What do you
think Egbert says about him?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t know and don&#8217;t care,&#8217; rejoined Kit.
Somehow, he felt it was rather mean to join
in abusing the man who had gone out after
him, all in the rain and the darkness. Still, he
was sure he hated the fellow more than ever
now, for had he not outwitted him and put
him under an obligation to him at the same
time? The boys did not notice his diffidence.</p>

<p>&#8216;Egbert says<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217; began Peter, and paused
to give his words more effect; &#8216;Egbert says&#8211;that&#8211;the
Doctor is in love with Jill.&#8217;</p>

<p>Christopher sat up and gazed at him. For
once his quick wit had not been quite so quick
as Egbert&#8217;s. So that was why Dr. Hurst had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
called her &#8216;Jill&#8217;; and that was what he had
meant just now by his parting words at the
gate!</p>

<p>&#8216;Egbert&#8217;s hit it,&#8217; he said morosely. &#8216;The
chap <i>is</i> in love with Jill. Poor Jill!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s what Wilfred says,&#8217; cried Peter, all
ready as usual for mischief. &#8216;He says Jill has
got to be saved from him, or else<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Jill saved?&#8217; echoed Kit, scornfully. &#8216;As if
she needed any saving from <i>that</i> idiot!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; objected Wilfred, shaking
his head. &#8216;Girls are so rum. Look at
Merton major&#8217;s aunt<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She isn&#8217;t a girl, she&#8217;s an <i>aunt</i>!&#8217; interrupted
Christopher.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, it&#8217;s all the same, really,&#8217; declared Wilfred.
&#8216;Merton major says she only married
that Indian chap because he bothered so, and
because she wanted to be obliging.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And Jill is <i>awfully</i> obliging, you know
she is,&#8217; added Peter. &#8216;You can&#8217;t tell what
may happen, if that Doctor goes on bothering
her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, what are we to do, then?&#8217; Kit condescended
to ask. &#8216;We can&#8217;t lock him up,
can we?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; admitted Wilfred, &#8216;we can&#8217;t lock him
up. But there&#8217;s lots of other things we can do.
We can see that she&#8217;s never left alone with
him, for instance. Babs is always with them
in the sickroom, that&#8217;s one thing. But what
happens when he comes out of the sickroom,
and Jill walks along the gallery with him and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
sometimes even down to the front door? That&#8217;s
dangerous, anyhow.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;In future,&#8217; said Peter, solemnly, &#8216;one of us
will always be on the look-out to join them
the moment they come out of the sickroom.
What else, Will?&#8217;</p>

<p>Wilfred reflected a moment. &#8216;Sometimes,&#8217;
he said at last, &#8216;I&#8217;ve known her to be taking
a walk in the garden, just as he happens to
drive up; and then they stay talking ever so
long before they go into the house. Once, he
even made her take him round the conservatory.
That must never happen again.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Never,&#8217; agreed Peter. &#8216;<i>I&#8217;ll</i> see to that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Look here,&#8217; said Christopher, doubtfully;
&#8216;perhaps Jill won&#8217;t like our hanging round
her like that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She may not like it <i>at the time</i>,&#8217; began
Wilfred, impressively.</p>

<p>&#8216;But she&#8217;ll thank us for it all her life afterwards,&#8217;
concluded Peter, with great solemnity.</p>

<p>Jill&#8217;s voice at the door made them start like
guilty conspirators. She was much too preoccupied
to notice their confusion, however.</p>

<p>&#8216;Has Kit come back?&#8217; she asked anxiously.
Christopher sprang out of the arm-chair, and
her face cleared. &#8216;I&#8217;m so glad; I was afraid
you were lost,&#8217; she said, taking his hand gently.
&#8216;Babs has just woke up,&#8217; she explained, as they
went upstairs together, &#8216;and she is still rather
upset about something. I think you can calm
her, if you will.&#8217;</p>

<p>Kit muttered something indistinctly, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
she went on talking in her soft voice. &#8216;The
child has got into her head that you have done
something to the Doctor, so I want you to
assure her that it is all right. Will you, Kit
dear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m the biggest brute,&#8217; burst out the boy,
&#8216;that ever<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nonsense!&#8217; said Jill, putting her hand over
his mouth. Then she opened the door of
Barbara&#8217;s room and they went in.</p>

<p>Auntie Anna was sitting by the child, trying
to soothe her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bless your little heart!&#8217; she was saying as
they entered. &#8216;There&#8217;s nothing the matter
with the Doctor, my dear. What makes you
think such a thing, eh?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8217; said the little fretful
voice from the bed. &#8216;Kit said&#8211;Kit said<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>Christopher pushed Jill on one side, and
suddenly knew what he had got to do.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s all right, Babe; I was only rotting,&#8217;
he said bluntly, and patted the hot little hand
that lay on the counterpane.</p>

<p>The bright, wistful eyes were fixed searchingly
on his face. &#8216;But you&#8217;ve sent him
wandering seven times round the world,&#8217; she
murmured wearily. &#8216;You said you had, Kit.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s all right, Babe,&#8217; said Kit, again. &#8216;He&#8217;s
come back now. I&#8217;ve just seen him.&#8217;</p>

<p>He only partly understood what she was
talking about, but he seemed to know how to
satisfy her, and the others drew back and left
him to do it alone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>&#8216;You&#8217;ve seen him?&#8217; asked Babs, wonderingly.
&#8216;But<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You see,&#8217; said Kit, desperately, &#8216;it doesn&#8217;t
take long to get round the world seven times,
when&#8211;when you&#8217;ve got a smart little cob like
his!&#8217;</p>

<p>The worried look faded out of the child&#8217;s
face, and she smiled for the first time. &#8216;That
isn&#8217;t the reason, Kit,&#8217; she told him. &#8216;It is
because he was once a fairy prince.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, is it?&#8217; remarked Kit.</p>

<p>The bright little eyes were closing sleepily,
and the aching bandaged head fell sideways on
the pillow.</p>

<p>&#8216;He has only got to kill the giant and rescue
the princess now,&#8217; she whispered contentedly.
And Kit went on stroking her hand till she was
sound asleep.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RESCUE OF A PRINCESS</span></h2>

<p>Barbara was none the worse for her relapse,
and she made such a good recovery in the
weeks that followed, that the Doctor decided
she could be moved to Crofts on the last day
of the holidays. Miss Finlayson vowed she
had never enjoyed her Easter holidays so
much before for she had persuaded Auntie
Anna and the boys to remain her guests the
whole time, to save her, as she said, from the
horrible feeling of loneliness that always seized
her as soon as the last fly went down the drive
with the last box on the top of it, and the last
girl sitting inside. &#8216;At my age,&#8217; she told them
laughingly, &#8216;it is not safe to be left alone.
Who knows that I might not begin talking
about rheumatism and nerves, if I had a whole
month to think about myself?&#8217; And Auntie
Anna, who never talked about rheumatism by
any chance, though it had bent her back for
her ten years ago, nodded her head wisely like
the old witch that she was, and consented to
remain at Wootton Beeches with her adopted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
daughter and her noisy young nephews until
Barbara was well enough to be taken home.
The boys, for their part, enjoyed themselves
every bit as well as if they had been at Crofts;
for Finny was first-rate company as long as she
was with them, and she contrived at the same
time to leave them to themselves just as much
as they wished to be left. And staying at a
girls&#8217; school was by no means such poor fun as
might have been expected; for it was big
enough for them to make as much noise in it
as they pleased without disturbing anybody,
while they had the run of a capital gymnasium,
and, as soon as their bicycles had been brought
from Crofts, could explore the country for
miles round as well. Altogether, the Easter
holidays were a great success, and there were
many groans when the month came to an end,
and school once more threatened to darken the
joy of their existence.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are a lucky beast, Kit,&#8217; observed Peter,
as they sat swinging on the yard gate a couple
of mornings before their departure. &#8216;Wish I
was you and needn&#8217;t go to school.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You wouldn&#8217;t like it, if you were me,&#8217;
answered Kit, shortly. Nobody ever guessed
how much he wished he were like other boys
and could lead the healthy life they professed
to despise so much.</p>

<p>Wilfred, who had just strolled up, had
occasional glimmerings of understanding where
Kit was concerned; and he had one now.
&#8216;Never mind, old chap,&#8217; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
consolingly. &#8216;You&#8217;ve got all the genius, you
know.&#8217;</p>

<p>Christopher kicked a stone across the yard
without speaking; and Peter hastened to
change the conversation, which he perceived
was in danger of becoming serious. Peter
never attempted to understand anybody, but he
had a determined objection to anything that
was serious.</p>

<p>&#8216;If we&#8217;ve done nothing else these holidays,
we have at least saved Jill from the Doctor,&#8217; he
remarked with a chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the good of that?&#8217; growled Kit.
He did not take the keen interest in the salvation
of Jill that the others expected from him,
though he certainly did not raise any grown-up
objections to it, as Egbert would have done.
Egbert was going to Oxford in October, and
he was getting far too grown-up for ordinary
intercourse with the rest of the family. Kit
was not in the least grown-up; besides, he
hated the Doctor&#8211;that was certain, because
he so constantly said he did. But it was a
pity, the others agreed, that he did not show
more enthusiasm over persecuting him.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a lot of good,&#8217; retorted Peter. &#8216;You
don&#8217;t want her to marry the chap, do
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>Kit smiled in a superior manner. &#8216;I&#8217;m not
interested in <i>marrying</i>,&#8217; he observed. &#8216;You
can&#8217;t have marrying, or any of that rot, without
girls. And I hate girls.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you hate Jill?&#8217; cried Wilfred, staring.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>Christopher kicked another stone across the
yard.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s different,&#8217; he said vaguely. &#8216;Jill&#8217;s
not a girl, exactly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is she, anyway?&#8217; demanded Peter.</p>

<p>Kit&#8217;s genius was hard pressed. It was so
stupid of people to take him literally. Robin
saved his embarrassment by suddenly rushing
helter-skelter into the yard, from the direction
of the carriage-drive.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s just driven in at the lodge gates,&#8217; he
panted. &#8216;An&#8217; Jill&#8217;s waiting on the front doorstep.
If you don&#8217;t look sharp you won&#8217;t cob
them in time.&#8217;</p>

<p>The conspirators glanced hastily at one
another. &#8216;It&#8217;s your turn, Kit,&#8217; said Wilfred.</p>

<p>Kit started uncomfortably. &#8216;I don&#8217;t think
so,&#8217; he objected. &#8216;I&#8217;m not in the mood, and I
should make a mess of it. You go, Peter.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All right, I&#8217;m on,&#8217; said Peter, and he strode
briskly towards the front of the house, swinging
his long arms as he went.</p>

<p>Robin danced round the other two gleefully.
&#8216;Silly old Doctor won&#8217;t marry Jill, won&#8217;t marry
Jill, all on a summer&#8217;s morning!&#8217; he chanted in
a kind of refrain he made up on the spur of the
moment.</p>

<p>Kit turned upon him sternly. &#8216;Chuck it,
Bobbin, unless you want your head cuffed!&#8217; he
commanded, and walked off before he could be
provoked into carrying out his threat.</p>

<p>Upstairs Barbara lay on the sofa by the
window and waited for the Doctor&#8217;s visit. Her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
leg was in plaster of Paris now, and she could
be lifted on to the sofa by Egbert, every morning.
It was less wearisome than lying in bed
all day, but even the fun of pretending she was
enchanted by an evil fairy did not make up for
the dulness of staying in one room all through
her first holidays. To be sure, she was going
to Crofts the day after to-morrow, and Auntie
Anna had promised that Jean and Angela
should come and see her the very next Saturday;
but that did not make up for everything,
and she hoped that if her bad fairy ever bewitched
her again, she would manage to do it
in term-time instead of when the boys came
home.</p>

<p>The Doctor drove up just below as she came
to this conclusion, and she forgot her own enchantment
in the more thrilling amusement of
thinking about his.</p>

<p>It was rather stupid of the Doctor, she
reflected, to be such a long time working out
the rest of his spell. Any one who had gone
round the world seven times, as easily and as
cheerfully as he had, might at least take the
trouble to find a princess to rescue. He must
really want to go on being a beast, she decided,
as she craned her neck over the window-sill
and watched him dismount from his gig. The
princes in the fairy tales never wanted to go on
being beasts; and it was very confusing. Just
then, Jill came out on the doorstep, and she
patted the horse and began to talk to the
Doctor. Barbara laughed softly to herself. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
only the cruel giant would come along now and
clap Jill into a dungeon, the Doctor could
rescue her on the spot and then stand before
her in his real shape. A prince and princess,
who had no giant to bring them together,
did not make the right sort of fairy tale at
all.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hullo! There <i>is</i> the giant!&#8217; exclaimed
Babs, immediately afterwards, as Peter came
striding across the lawn to interrupt the conversation
on the doorstep. &#8216;He must be the
giant,&#8217; she continued, watching the trio below
her with great interest, &#8216;because the Doctor is
looking so angry and Jill has such a funny,
frightened look on her face. Besides, Peter
looks like a giant; he&#8217;s so big and dangerous
looking. I wonder if the Doctor will kill the
giant <i>now</i>, or&#8211;oh, dear! they&#8217;ve both come
indoors and left the giant outside. I don&#8217;t
think I ever heard of the prince and princess
running <i>away</i> from the giant before. I&#8217;m sure
that&#8217;s wrong. How Peter is grinning&#8211;just
like a horrid old giant. <i>Coo-ey</i>, Peter!&#8217;</p>

<p>The prince and princess came into the room,
talking busily.</p>

<p>&#8216;If you don&#8217;t come to-morrow,&#8217; Dr. Hurst
was saying, &#8216;I am afraid it will have to be
put off indefinitely, as I am going away for ten
days. When I come back, you will have gone
to Crofts, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I will ask Auntie Anna,&#8217; answered Jill.</p>

<p>Barbara seized the first opportunity to interrupt
them. &#8216;What&#8217;s going to happen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
to-morrow, Dr. Hurst?&#8217; she demanded. &#8216;Are
you going to carry off the princess at last?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8217; said Dr. Hurst, sitting
down beside her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why don&#8217;t you?&#8217; demanded the child.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said Dr. Hurst, smiling, &#8216;I don&#8217;t
know whether the princess is ready to be
carried off. Are you so anxious to get rid of
her?&#8217;</p>

<p>Both he and Jill were used by this time to
her fancy for weaving the people she liked best
into a fairy tale. But Jill was not smiling so
much as usual this morning.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t want to be carried off by anybody,
thank you, Babs,&#8217; she said demurely.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, that doesn&#8217;t make any difference,&#8217; Babs
assured her. &#8216;If you&#8217;re a princess, you just
have to be carried off whether you like it or
not.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then I&#8217;ll be a new kind of princess, and
refuse to have anything to do with the prince
when he comes. Shall I, Babs?&#8217; suggested
Jill, lightly.</p>

<p>Barbara looked at her doubtfully. Jill&#8217;s idea
was not like anything she had ever read in a
fairy tale, and she did not think much of it.</p>

<p>&#8216;You see, you&#8217;re <i>not</i> a new kind of princess,&#8217;
she answered simply. And the Doctor looked
amused; but Jill hurried away to the other
end of the room and began talking about
temperatures.</p>

<p>The giant must have been very busy all that
day, for he did not come near the invalid&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
room till just before supper. Kit came, and so
did the other boys, but they only said vaguely
that Peter was in the barn; and when he ran
in at last to say good-night to her, she knew it
was no use trying to find out what his plans
were for locking up the princess. For Peter
did not know that he was a giant, and he did
not know that Jill was a princess; and it was
better to go on with the story in her own way
than to provoke Peter&#8217;s great laugh by telling
him about it. So she went to sleep and
dreamed of the dear old magician, who had
been away from her kingdom for four whole
months, and was going to be away for two
months more; and in her dream he came back
and rescued the princess himself, and turned
the beast into a prince for her. But that was
only a dream, and in the morning the end of
the story seemed further off than ever.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do let me see what you have been writing,
Peter,&#8217; she shouted through her open window,
just before lunch-time. Peter and Wilfred had
been more than an hour composing a letter on
the lawn below, with Robin jumping round
them all the time, jogging their elbows and
otherwise provoking them into outbreaks of fury
that did not improve his behaviour in the least.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Do</i>, there&#8217;s a dear, nice, darling boy,&#8217; begged
Barbara, as the conspirators looked at one
another and hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a secret,&#8217; said Wilfred.</p>

<p>&#8216;I can keep a secret; you <i>know</i> I can,&#8217; cried
Babs, indignantly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>&#8216;It&#8217;s about Jill,&#8217; explained Peter, &#8216;and you
might do her a great and lasting injury if you
were to go and blab. Mightn&#8217;t she, Will?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I think it&#8217;s a shame,&#8217; protested Babs. &#8216;Here
am I shut up all alone, with a bad leg that
hurts and hurts and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, let her see it. Anything for a quiet
life,&#8217; interrupted Wilfred, and Peter strode
upstairs with the letter.</p>

<p>&#8216;Promise faithfully you&#8217;ll endure any amount
of awful tortures, sooner than betray us?&#8217; he
demanded threateningly, when he arrived in
her room.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll be killed first, honour bright,&#8217; said Barbara,
solemnly; and the letter passed into her
hands. Her countenance grew very perplexed
as she read it; for, to tell the truth, she could
make neither head nor tail of its mysterious
contents.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8216;Dearest Jill,&#8217; it ran,&#8211;&#8216;We the undersigned
are anxious to save you from an awful and
terrible fate that is hanging over your head.
The barn, we know, is not a place you would
choose to spend a happy afternoon in, but Peter
has cleaned out as much of the filth as he can
(he found several decayed martins&#8217; nests full of
insects, two dead rats in an unspeakable condition,
and a rotting owlet that made you squirm;
so you see it might have been much worse,
mightn&#8217;t it?) And I (that&#8217;s Wilfred) have successfully
deposited in a box you will find
secreted in the manger, two apples, some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
seed-cake (sorry it isn&#8217;t plum, but there wasn&#8217;t any),
and a bottle of ginger beer. This, we think,
will keep starvation from gnawing at you till
the hour of release, which is seven o&#8217;clock,
when we hope the Doctor will have given up
waiting for you. We would put some more
things to eat, but they are a little difficult to
get without arousing suspicion; and we are
afraid of attracting the mice and rats, which are
plentiful already, and of which we believe you
are afraid. We the undersigned all hope, dear
Jill, that you will not attribute base motives to
our action in this matter. We do assure you,
honest Injun, that though you may dislike us
for the moment, you will thank us deeply all
the rest of your life.&#8211;We have the honour to
remain,</p>

<div style='width:12em; margin:0 0 0 auto;'>
<p class='sc'>
Wilfred Everard Berkeley,<br />
Peter Everard Berkeley,<br />
Robin Everard Berkeley.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8216;<i>P.S.</i>&#8211;Kit isn&#8217;t in it, because he raised
objections and we shunted him. So your lifelong
gratitude need not be extended to him.&#8217;</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8216;But when are you going to give Jill the
letter?&#8217; asked Barbara, looking extremely puzzled,
as she came to the end of this elaborate
composition.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re not going to give it to her,&#8217; explained
Peter. &#8216;It&#8217;s going to be dropped into the barn
through a hole in the roof, as soon as Robin
has coaxed her to go inside. The letter is to
explain why we&#8217;ve locked her<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>He did not finish his sentence, for Wilfred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
called him from below, and he seized the sheet
of paper and scampered off with it.</p>

<p>Barbara was left in a great state of bewilderment.
Something was evidently going to happen
to Jill, and it was apparently intended to
save her from something that was much worse;
but what it all meant was a mystery to her,
and there was no one about to give her any
more details. The three conspirators were
careful to keep out of her way, and she did
not see any more of them until after lunch,
when they raced out of the front door and disappeared
in the direction of the nine-acre field.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m going to leave you for half an hour,&#8217;
said Jill, when Barbara had finished her midday
meal. &#8216;Bobbin has been worrying me all
dinner-time to go and look at a baby rabbit he
has found, so I promised to run down to the
barn and meet him there. Do you mind?&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara said she did not mind at all; and
she was left behind, consumed with curiosity as
to whether Jill was really going to be locked
into the barn, and whether it really could be for
her good, as the boys had said, and whether
Jill would be angry with them for doing it or
would give them her lifelong gratitude. Somehow,
Babs did not believe in the lifelong gratitude
much; it did not seem likely that Jill
would be grateful to any one for shutting her
up in a dark and dirty barn for a whole afternoon,
even if it was to save her from an awful
fate that still remained to be explained. As
she thought about it, Babs even began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
wonder if she had been right in promising not to
warn Jill. But then, if it <i>was</i> to save her from
an awful fate, as Peter declared it was, it would
have been very unkind to keep her from going
down to the barn.</p>

<p>She gave up trying to reason it out, and
hoped it was all a joke, and that Jill would
come back again at the end of half an hour.
But more than half an hour passed by, and still
she did not come back. Everything suddenly
grew very dull. The garden looked more deserted
than usual, and after the pony carriage
had come round and taken Finny and Auntie
Anna and Egbert for a drive, there was not
another sound to break the stillness. Babs
began to feel neglected; she had not once been
left alone like this, ever since she was first
taken ill, and she found it extremely depressing.
If it was really necessary for the future
happiness of Jill that she should be kept in the
barn all the afternoon, some one else might
have been told off to take her place in the
sickroom. Besides, as the afternoon wore on,
the little invalid realised with some sadness that
unless Jill did come in, there would be no one
to get her tea ready; and she wanted her tea
rather badly.</p>

<p>At last, to her intense relief, a thump came
at the door, and Kit rushed unceremoniously
into the room.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where&#8217;s Jill?&#8217; he demanded hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish I knew for certain, but I don&#8217;t,&#8217; said
Barbara, plaintively.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>&#8216;Then they&#8217;ve done it!&#8217; exclaimed Kit, in a
tragic tone, and he dropped into a chair and
looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Done what?&#8217; inquired Babs, eagerly. Kit&#8217;s
behaviour was as remarkable as every one else&#8217;s
to-day, so perhaps she was going to get at the
truth at last.</p>

<p>&#8216;Locked her up in the barn!&#8217; gasped Kit.
&#8216;They said they were going to, yesterday, but
I thought they were only rotting. I told &#8217;em
it wasn&#8217;t good enough, and I&#8217;d have nothing to
do with it, so I s&#8217;pose that&#8217;s why they didn&#8217;t
tell me any more. And then, I forgot all about
it; and after dinner to-day I went into Finny&#8217;s
study to read a stunning book I&#8217;d found there;
and I didn&#8217;t think of anything, till it suddenly
struck me how awfully quiet everything was.
If she&#8217;s disappeared, they must have done it,
stupid owls!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But isn&#8217;t it all right?&#8217; cried Barbara, looking
distressed. &#8216;Peter said it was to save her
from an awful fate<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s all very well,&#8217; returned Kit; &#8216;but
the game isn&#8217;t worth it, and that&#8217;s what I told
them. You see, the Doctor&#8217;s coming after tea
to-day, to fetch Jill and take her over the new
infirmary he&#8217;s so keen about, because Jill is nuts
on nursing and all that, don&#8217;t you know. Well,
Peter overheard them talking about it yesterday
and Auntie Anna said at breakfast that she&#8217;d
come home from her drive in time to go too, if
she could. But we all knew that she wouldn&#8217;t
get back in time, most likely; and besides, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
Doctor meant business from the look of him,
Peter said, so he&#8217;d be dead certain to come
early enough to go off with Jill alone. Trust
him! That was jolly dangerous, you see,
because the chap is going away to-morrow, and
it&#8217;s their last chance of being together.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why is that dangerous?&#8217; asked Barbara,
trying hard to follow his bewildering tale.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, well, if he&#8217;s ever going to ask her to
marry him, or any of that rot, he must be going
to do it to-day,&#8217; explained Kit, with a certain
contempt in his voice. &#8216;Anyhow, what we&#8217;ve
been trying to do all the holidays is to save Jill
from the Doctor; so naturally we were rather
upset when Peter brought us the news. But I
said I&#8217;d have nothing to do with locking any
one up, &#8217;specially Jill; so they said I could
make myself scarce, and I did.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Kit!&#8217; exclaimed Barbara, opening her
eyes, &#8216;do you think Jill is in that horrible dark
barn all this time?&#8217;</p>

<p>Kit sprang to his feet and made for the
door. &#8216;I&#8217;ll go and see if I can find those idiots,&#8217;
he said, but an exclamation from the sofa made
him look back. Babs was clapping her hands
wildly, and her face had suddenly reddened
with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s all right, Kit. It&#8217;s beautiful,&#8217; she was
crying joyfully. &#8216;Don&#8217;t stop them, Kit; don&#8217;t
help her to escape, whatever you do. Leave
her alone till the prince comes. Don&#8217;t you see
he&#8217;ll be able to break the spell at last!&#8217;</p>

<p>Kit did not see at all. Indeed, he looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
rather alarmed, and came back into the room.
&#8216;Look here, Babe, you&#8217;re not going to get
excited again, or anything like that, are you?&#8217;
he asked her, nervously.</p>

<p>Barbara set his mind at rest by laughing
merrily. &#8216;You silly old Kit, of course I&#8217;m not!&#8217;
she said. &#8216;I never felt so jolly in my life!&#8217;</p>

<p>Christopher sped away, reassured, and Barbara
lay back on her cushions and waited impatiently
for the sound of the Doctor&#8217;s gig. She
did not have to wait long, and she waved her
hand gaily in answer to the flourish of his whip
with which he greeted her as he drove up to
the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come up here, Dr. Hurst, and be as quick
as you possibly can!&#8217; she called down to him;
and a minute later he was in the room.</p>

<p>The first thing he did was to ask where Jill
was, just as Kit had done. Barbara laughed
more merrily than ever. Her small black eyes
were glittering with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8216;She <i>has</i> been locked up by the cruel old
giant, and you can go and rescue her at last,&#8217;
she told him.</p>

<p>Dr. Hurst frowned slightly. &#8216;What do you
mean, child?&#8217; he asked a little impatiently.
He was evidently not in a mood for joking,
and Barbara instantly became grave.</p>

<p>&#8216;I didn&#8217;t mean to play, but it <i>is</i> so like a
fairy story,&#8217; she said penitently. &#8216;And it&#8217;s quite
true about the locking up. They&#8217;ve put her
in the barn, Peter and the others have,&#8211;not
Kit,&#8211;and they mean to keep her there till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>
you&#8217;ve gone away, so that&#8211;so that you won&#8217;t
get a chance of marrying and living happily
ever after! It&#8217;s to save Jill from you, they say,
but Kit&#8217;s furious about it, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>The Doctor flung his driving-gloves on the
table. They were quite new ones, she noticed,
and he had even forgotten to take the tissue
paper off the buttons of one of them. &#8216;Where
is the barn?&#8217; he asked grimly.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s at the far end of the nine-acre field,&#8217;
explained Barbara, and before she could say
any more she found she was alone.</p>

<p>Excitement had made her forget all about
her tea, though the hour for it was long past.
She wished with all her heart that she could be
transported to the scene of the rescue and
actually see the princess fall into the prince&#8217;s
arms, while the giant lay stretched at their feet.
Then she remembered that the giant was Peter,
and perhaps Will and Bobbin too, and she hoped
he would not lie stretched there for long.</p>

<p>The minutes crept slowly by, and still no one
came in. It was no use looking out of the
window, for the nine-acre field was on the other
side of the house, beyond the orchard. Then
she began to be afraid that something dreadful
must have happened. She reminded herself
again that Peter was the giant, and that the
Doctor was small and slight in comparison, even
for a prince. Supposing, contrary though it
was to all the laws of fairy tale, that the giant
should be too strong for the prince, and the
princess should not be rescued after all? At
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
last she heard the welcome sound of footsteps
coming along the gallery, and then Jill opened
the door softly and hurried up to her. The
Doctor was just behind her.</p>

<p>&#8216;My dear little Babs!&#8217; cried Jill, dropping
on her knees beside the sofa, &#8216;have you been
wondering what had become of me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, no,&#8217; answered the child; &#8216;I knew about
the dark and gruesome dungeon. But I think
I&#8217;d like my tea, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course you would,&#8217; said Jill, in much
distress, and she began bustling about the room
and making preparations for tea in quite a
flustered sort of way. Babs turned to the
Doctor. A question was burning on the tip of
her tongue, and he smiled encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Did</i> you rescue the princess?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;I did,&#8217; answered the Doctor, briefly.</p>

<p>She looked anxiously at his tie, which had
wandered under his right ear, and at his collar,
which was crumpled. &#8216;Did you hurt the giant
<i>much</i>?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;I found him in three pieces,&#8217; answered the
Doctor, gravely, &#8216;and I give you my word I
did not leave him in more.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara was not yet satisfied. &#8216;How did
you get into the dungeon?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Through the door,&#8217; replied the Doctor.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes wide. &#8216;Then you must
have stepped over the body of the giant,&#8217; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8216;So I did,&#8217; laughed Dr. Hurst. &#8216;But do not
let that alarm you, for here he comes.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>The door was pushed open once more, and
the three conspirators tumbled into the room.
Their ties and collars were in much the same
condition as the Doctor&#8217;s, but they seemed none
the worse for that. Indeed, they looked rather
cheerful over it than otherwise, until they saw
the Doctor sitting there, holding Barbara&#8217;s hand;
and then they stopped short and hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do, do tell me,&#8217; implored Babs. &#8216;How did
Dr. Hurst rescue Jill?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll tell you, Babs dear,&#8217; cried Robin, suddenly
dancing up to the Doctor, and climbing on his
knee in quite a friendly manner. &#8216;He came
walking with big long steps up to the door of
the barn, where we was keeping guard over Jill;
and he said, &#8220;Who can wrestle, out of you
young scamps?&#8221; &#8217;Course I said <i>I</i> could, but
he just swinged me up in the apple tree an&#8217;
left me there, which was horrid, but I didn&#8217;t
mind much, &#8217;cause I saw all the fun. An&#8217; the
others said they could, if he liked; an&#8217; the
Doctor said whoever won was to have Jill, an&#8217;
Peter said &#8220;Yes,&#8221; &#8217;cos he&#8217;s lots bigger&#8217;n the
Doctor and he thought he&#8217;d win. But he didn&#8217;t
win, nobody did, &#8217;cept only Dr. Hurst; so he
got Jill and brought her back here; an&#8217; I
climbed down from the apple tree all by myself,
an&#8217; the others shook hands with the Doctor and
stopped behind, lookin&#8217; scared!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I beg to state,&#8217; said Jill, severely, from the
other side of the room, where she was preparing
tea, &#8216;that nobody has <i>got</i> me, as you call
it. And the sooner you all go out of this
room and leave me alone with my patient, the
better.&#8217;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i8'></a><img src='images/illus-310.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8216;So he got Jill&#8217;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>&#8216;I say,&#8217; began Wilfred, who was standing
first on one leg and then on the other, and
trying not to laugh, &#8216;you&#8217;re not really wild
with us, are you, Jill?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m simply <i>furious</i> with you,&#8217; said Jill, and
she began cutting bread and butter with vigour.</p>

<p>&#8216;We really did it for your good,&#8217; added
Peter, putting on an air of mock penitence.
&#8216;How were we to know you didn&#8217;t <i>want</i> to be
saved from the Doctor?&#8217;</p>

<p>Jill tossed her head and went on cutting
bread and butter still, with her back turned to
them all. &#8216;Next time you try to save any
one from any one else,&#8217; she remarked, &#8216;you&#8217;d
better make sure first that she does want
saving.&#8217;</p>

<p>Anything they might have said in reply to
this was drowned by the noisy entrance of
Christopher. He bounced into the room and
shook his fist wrathfully at his brothers.</p>

<p>&#8216;Look here, you fellows!&#8217; he shouted. &#8216;Next
time you shut a chap into a <i>pig-sty</i>, perhaps
you&#8217;ll choose a pig-sty that doesn&#8217;t belong to
a pig that comes home at tea-time and bangs
against the door. I&#8217;d like to<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>He was brought to an abrupt pause. It
suddenly struck him that there was something
a little odd about the way every one was
assembled in the Babe&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dry up, Kit!&#8217; said Wilfred, with a huge
sigh. &#8216;You were quite right; the game wasn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span>
worth it. She didn&#8217;t want to be saved, after
all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s just a girl,&#8217; added Peter, in a tone of
deep dejection.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s a <i>princess</i>!&#8217; insisted Barbara, from
the sofa.</p>

<p>Christopher looked swiftly round the room.
The attitude of every one seemed a little
strained. Jill was cutting enough bread and
butter for a school, and the crumbs flew in all
directions as she stood there with her back to
them all. The Doctor was smiling in a way
that was clearly put on, and Bobbin was
examining his watch-chain with a familiarity
that would not have seemed possible an hour
ago.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I&#8217;m bothered!&#8217; said Kit, at last. The
truth was gradually dawning upon him. &#8216;Do
you mean to say that you two have been and
gone and got <i>engaged</i>, while we&#8217;ve been trying
to save you?&#8217; he demanded. &#8216;<i>Have</i> you, Jill?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, don&#8217;t bother,&#8217; grumbled Jill. &#8216;Why
can&#8217;t you ask Dr. Hurst?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Have</i> you?&#8217; repeated Kit, turning to the
Doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ask Jill,&#8217; replied the Doctor, smiling more
than ever.</p>

<p>&#8216;Boys,&#8217; said Christopher, fixing his spectacles
firmly on his nose and staring solemnly at
his brothers, &#8216;we&#8217;ve made shocking idiots of
ourselves.&#8217;</p>

<p>Into the middle of them all now walked Mrs.
Crofton of Crofts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span>&#8216;Such a trouble as I&#8217;ve had to get back in
time, my dear,&#8217; she was beginning, when she
too stopped short and seemed to find things a
little unusual.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hey-day!&#8217; she cried, leaning on her blue-knobbed
cane and looking sharply round.
&#8216;What&#8217;s every one looking so glum about, I
should like to know?&#8217;</p>

<p>Nobody answered her at first. Dr. Hurst
put Robin down and rose to his feet, and he
stopped smiling at last, while Jill dropped the
bread-knife and turned round with a very red
face; but neither of them spoke. It was the
Babe who came to the rescue, and it was she
who explained everything in her small, dreamy
voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dr. Hurst has saved Jill from the giant,&#8217;
she said, &#8216;and they are going away to their
own kingdom, to live happily ever after! I do
wish,&#8217; she added wistfully, &#8216;that the magician
would come back too. Then things would be
<i>quite</i> beautiful.&#8217;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MAGICIAN</span></h2>

<p>The triumvirate sat under the old cedar tree
at Crofts, and once more they discussed the
important affairs of the little world at Wootton
Beeches. It was the first Saturday in the
term; and Auntie Anna, true to her promise,
had invited Jean and Angela to drive over and
spend it with Barbara. The spring had come
in with a rush, and May had dawned in such a
flood of warm sunshine that the child was able
to pass most of her time on a couch in the
garden. The Doctor, in spite of the ten miles
that lay between his house and Crofts, came
nearly every day to see how she was; and he
hinted at a promise of crutches in ten days&#8217;
time, after which she was to go away to the
seaside and get strong enough to return to
school at the half-term. It was very nice,
Barbara thought, to see the Doctor so often,
now that she was so much better and did not
really need him; but Christopher was very
sarcastic on the subject.</p>

<p>&#8216;S&#8217;pose you think he comes to see <i>you</i>, don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>
you?&#8217; he remarked scornfully; and when
pressed by Barbara for a more definite explanation
of the Doctor&#8217;s actions, he condescended to
add: &#8216;Once a chap gets engaged to a <i>girl</i>, it&#8217;s
the <i>girl</i> who&#8217;s at the bottom of everything he
does!&#8217;</p>

<p>The day was so hot that Kit and Bobbin
came out to join the others under the cedar
tree, and they flung themselves on the grass in
different stages of exhaustion. Now and then,
they threw in a lazy contribution to the conversation
that was going on over their heads,
though at first this related entirely to the
number of new girls, the alterations in the
classes, and other bits of school gossip. Then,
however, it took a personal turn, and Christopher&#8217;s
comments grew satirical.</p>

<p>&#8216;Has anybody asked after me?&#8217; inquired
Barbara.</p>

<p>&#8216;What a question!&#8217; scoffed Christopher. &#8216;A
kid like you!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They have, though,&#8217; declared Jean, making
a great effort to overcome her shyness of
Barbara Berkeley&#8217;s clever brother. &#8216;Everybody
did, first thing. You&#8217;d never think the
Babe had only been there one term.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, well, that&#8217;s because she smashed herself
up,&#8217; said Kit, cheerfully. &#8216;Girls always
fuss over you, if you kill yourself ever so little.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They <i>don&#8217;t</i>, Kit,&#8217; objected Babs.</p>

<p>&#8216;Guess what Margaret Hulme said about
you yesterday,&#8217; put in Angela, eagerly. Angela
was not nearly so shy as Jean, and, much to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>
Barbara&#8217;s astonishment, Kit found her &#8216;better
fun&#8217; in consequence. It seemed a little strange
that the genius of the family should not be able
to appreciate the amazing qualities of Jean
Murray.</p>

<p>&#8216;What did she say about me?&#8217; asked
Barbara, only to be interrupted by another jeer
from Christopher.</p>

<p>&#8216;Never knew such cockiness as the Babe&#8217;s,&#8217;
he laughed, tilting his straw hat a little more
over his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8216;Babs always thinks that everybody&#8217;s always
talkin&#8217; about her,&#8217; added Bobbin, in his shrillest
voice.</p>

<p>Barbara stretched as far as she could, and
managed with difficulty to knock off Kit&#8217;s hat
with the end of a stick. Robin was out of reach,
so she contented herself with frowning at him
severely, and then leaned back again and began
to fan herself with her handkerchief. Everything
made one feel hot this afternoon. &#8216;What
did Margaret say about me?&#8217; she repeated
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8216;It was when I was waiting to put away her
books, just before dinner yesterday,&#8217; Angela
related with eagerness; &#8216;or was it before tea?
No! I think it was before dinner, because<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, get on, Angela, do!&#8217; interrupted Jean,
impatiently. Even the presence of Barbara
Berkeley&#8217;s clever brother, which was paralysing
her, could not keep the leader of the junior
playroom from snubbing Angela.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, she said Babs was the most popular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317'></a>317</span>
girl in the school,&#8217; continued Angela. &#8216;She
did, honour bright, and I&#8217;m <i>not</i> exaggerating,
Jean. She said it to Ruth Oliver, and Ruth
Oliver said: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it queer? Such a little
kid, too.&#8221; And Margaret said: &#8220;That&#8217;s just it,
stupid!&#8221; Then she saw me listening, and she
told me not to listen but to make myself scarce;
and of course I wasn&#8217;t listening at all, I was
only<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s nothing new in <i>that</i>&#8217; interrupted
Jean, looking superior. &#8216;Everybody knows
that the Babe<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217; Here she caught Kit&#8217;s
eye, and stopped hastily. She was not sure
that she liked Barbara Berkeley&#8217;s clever
brother; he had such a queer way of looking
at one. Nobody in the junior playroom ever
made her feel like that.</p>

<p>Barbara was in deep perplexity. &#8216;Is that
why every one clapped, then, on the night of
the display?&#8217; she said wonderingly.</p>

<p>Christopher looked in mock reproach at
Angela. &#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t have told her,&#8217; he
said. &#8216;She won&#8217;t be fit to speak to for a month
now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, don&#8217;t, Kit!&#8217; retorted Barbara, more
from habit than because she really resented his
words. As a matter of fact she had hardly
heard them, for she was busy puzzling things
over in her mind. &#8216;I can&#8217;t think what it all
means,&#8217; she went on; &#8216;every one used to complain
of me so. There was Mary Wells, for
instance<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Mary Wells <i>adores</i> you!&#8217; cried Angela,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span>
in her effusive manner. &#8216;She said so directly
you broke your leg.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara puzzled still more. &#8216;I don&#8217;t understand
about Margaret Hulme a bit, though,&#8217;
she observed. &#8216;Only the day before the display,
she told me I was a little nuisance,
because I didn&#8217;t hear her the first time she
spoke to me; so of course I thought she hated
me!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That was before you broke your leg, though,&#8217;
explained Jean.</p>

<p>&#8216;She <i>adores</i> you now,&#8217; added Angela.</p>

<p>Kit and Bobbin burst out laughing, but
Barbara went on puzzling, and did not notice
them. Adoration at Wootton Beeches seemed
to spring from the strangest causes. After
being more or less neglected for a whole term
by the greater part of her school-fellows, it was
at least surprising to be suddenly placed on a
pinnacle of fame, just because she had broken
her leg. If she had only guessed at Angela&#8217;s
envy of that same broken leg&#8211;an envy that was
probably shared by half the junior playroom&#8211;she
might have been still further amazed.</p>

<p>The boys strolled indoors to find Auntie
Anna and to beg for tea in the garden; and
the conversation under the cedar tree grew
more intimate. Jean came out of her shell, and
talked about her home in Edinburgh in a way
she had never done before, even on half-holidays
at school; and Angela, in her turn,
gave an elaborate description of her eldest
sister&#8217;s drawing-room dress, and of the longing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319'></a>319</span>
it had aroused in her own frivolous little mind
to be presented at Court herself.</p>

<p>&#8216;And so I shall be, some day; mother says
so!&#8217; she announced, spreading out the folds of
her rough serge skirt, and seeing it in imagination
many times its length and composed of
shimmering satin.</p>

<p>&#8216;I shan&#8217;t,&#8217; said Jean, regarding her with
scorn. &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to be presented. Any
stupid idiot can put on a white satin dress,
miles long, and grin at Queen Victoria. <i>I</i>
want to be clever like father, and get a degree
at college, and lecture to thousands and thousands
of people, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, don&#8217;t be like that, Jean,&#8217; interrupted
Barbara, earnestly. &#8216;If you&#8217;re going to give
lectures you&#8217;ll have to go away from all your
children, for months and months and months,
and leave them to break all their legs, all by
themselves, and&#8211;oh, it <i>is</i> so horrible to break
your leg all by yourself!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Poor dear,&#8217; said Angela, ready as usual with
a tearful and demonstrative sympathy.</p>

<p>Jean was much too wrapped up in her future
to sympathise with anybody. &#8216;I dare say I
shan&#8217;t have any children,&#8217; she said, seized with
a happy inspiration. &#8216;You can&#8217;t have everything,
and I&#8217;d much sooner have a degree.&#8217;</p>

<p>Barbara looked at her in some doubt.
&#8216;That&#8217;s all very well,&#8217; she remarked, &#8216;but you&#8217;ll
be jolly dull if you don&#8217;t look out. <i>I</i> don&#8217;t
mean to go without children; I&#8217;m going to
have millions of &#8217;em&#8211;all boys&#8211;see if I don&#8217;t!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320'></a>320</span>
Then we can always be sure of having enough
for sides, without inviting strangers to come
and play. You can never be sure how
strangers are going to play, and sometimes
they spoil the game, and that&#8217;s a bore.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If you have boys of your own, you&#8217;ll be a
mother; and if you&#8217;re a mother, you won&#8217;t join
in the games at all. Mothers only sit and look
on, and send the ones to bed that can&#8217;t agree,&#8217;
said Angela, with an air of experience.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t advise you to be a mother, Babe,&#8217;
added Jean, earnestly. &#8216;You&#8217;ll have to mend
such a lot of socks, and p&#8217;r&#8217;aps make babies&#8217;
clothes too; and you&#8217;ve been a whole term
getting round the hem of one flannel petticoat,
as it is.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You <i>can</i> get things ready-made,&#8217; answered
Barbara, but her tone did not sound hopeful.
She had to own sadly to herself that she was
not cut out for a mother, and she fell back on
the more practical futures of other people.
&#8216;Wilfred&#8217;s going to be a doctor, after all,&#8217; she
told them, with great pride. &#8216;Auntie Anna
says she&#8217;ll stand all the money that father can&#8217;t,
and he&#8217;s going to St. Thomas&#8217;s&#8211;Will is, I
mean. Isn&#8217;t it awfully splendid?&#8217;</p>

<p>Her friends murmured something appropriate,
but they were not deeply interested in the
career of Wilfred. At school, the girls&#8217; conversation
was largely made up of details of this
kind; but Crofts was not school, and neither
Jean nor Angela felt inspired to carry on the
discussion. Babs, however, failed to notice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321'></a>321</span>
their want of enthusiasm. Everything was
happening exactly like the fairy story she had
planned, the fairy story that had begun in the
old London house, on the day that a certain
dragon had entered it as a fairy godmother;
and for the moment she was back again in her
own kingdom, where the old witch still
wandered about in her steeple-hat, in the
company of Kit the prince, and where the
twice-disenchanted beast was placing a crown
on the charming head of the princess who had
waited so long for him, and where a crowd of
other princesses, after breaking their heads and
their legs and suffering numerous unpleasant
penalties of the kind, had at last returned from
their banishment and were hailing the child
herself as their queen. But one familiar figure
was still missing from her fairy kingdom; and
the little queen came sadly back to the world
under the cedar tree, with a sigh and a murmured
remark about &#8216;America&#8217; and &#8216;lectures&#8217;
that her listeners only half understood. They
recognised the Babe&#8217;s very natural wish for her
father&#8217;s return, but they did not know how the
wish had grown into a longing since her
accident, during the weary days in which there
had been no school to distract her, and nothing
to do but to think.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;ll be back in two months, won&#8217;t he?&#8217;
asked Jean, meaning to be sympathetic, though
her manner was awkward.</p>

<p>&#8216;Two months!&#8217; echoed Babs, dolefully,
&#8216;What&#8217;s two months?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322'></a>322</span>&#8216;It&#8217;s years, isn&#8217;t it?&#8217; responded Angela,
with her accustomed inaccuracy.</p>

<p>Having secured their sympathy, such as it
was, Barbara allowed herself to become more
doleful still. &#8216;He must have missed all our
letters, too,&#8217; she sighed. &#8216;The last one he sent
us was from some awful American place, that
Kit says is in the map if you&#8217;ve got a month to
look for it, only you haven&#8217;t!&#8211;and he never
told us where to write next, and he didn&#8217;t say
a word about me. So he&#8217;s not even heard yet
that I fell off the rings!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Never mind, Babs dear,&#8217; said Angela,
consolingly; &#8216;think how <i>proud</i> you will be
when you can tell him all about it yourself.&#8217;</p>

<p>Not appreciating the distinction of having
broken her leg quite so warmly as Angela,
Babs did not respond; and the arrival of tea,
and with it every one from the house, made
her give up the immediate attempt to pity herself.
After all, people who went away to
America to lecture could not leave their
children to break their legs by themselves for
ever; and meanwhile, there was home-made
cake and strawberry jam under the cedar tree.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of tea, just as Robin,
with a wavering hand, was conveying a second
cup to Babs, that the wonderful event happened.
Jill had the best view of the house from where
she sat at the tea-table, and her sudden exclamation
interrupted the jeers of the others over
Robin&#8217;s strenuous performance.</p>

<p>&#8216;Such a funny-looking man is coming up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323'></a>323</span>
the drive!&#8217; she remarked. &#8216;He&#8217;s wearing the
very oddest kind of clothes, too&#8211;a sort of
Inverness cape, and a squashy brown hat.
And do look at the way he is walking, with his
arms swinging about&#8211;just like Peter, when
he&#8217;s in a hurry.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He must be a tramp,&#8217; said Angela, giggling.</p>

<p>Everybody looked round, except Barbara,
who made a plaintive request, that nobody
heard, for her couch to be wheeled into a
different position.</p>

<p>Then Auntie Anna gave a little shriek, and
dropped her pince-nez into her lap.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bless my soul!&#8217; she cried, fumbling for
them in an agitated manner. &#8216;Why, it looks
exactly like&#8211;I do believe&#8211;look, Jill! Your
eyes are younger than<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>The boys were sharper than Jill, though,
and they settled the question at once in their
own riotous fashion. Barbara&#8217;s second cup of
tea fell with a crash and a splash, before she
could reach out her hand for it, and her two
brothers rushed shouting and screaming across
the lawn. In another instant they had disappeared
in the folds of the Inverness cape;
and Angela Wilkins realised with a shock that
she had called Barbara Berkeley&#8217;s father a
tramp!</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8216;Well, Everard, and what have you to say
for yourself?&#8217; demanded Auntie Anna, in a
severe tone, as soon as she could make herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324'></a>324</span>
heard. For quite ten minutes, every one had
been talking at once.</p>

<p>&#8216;What have I to say?&#8217; repeated Mr.
Berkeley, with his eyes twinkling. &#8216;Why,
plum-cake, to be sure! You haven&#8217;t offered
me any tea yet.&#8217;</p>

<p>His sons nearly wrecked the tea-table in
their efforts to be first in supplying his wants;
and Auntie Anna gave up the attempt to be
firm.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, well,&#8217; she said, shaking her head,
&#8216;you always were incorrigible, Everard! But
what about the end of your lecturing tour?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There won&#8217;t be any end, as far as I&#8217;m concerned,&#8217;
smiled her brother, devouring plum-cake
with avidity.</p>

<p>&#8216;But&#8211;but what did they <i>say</i> to your extraordinary
departure?&#8217; cried Auntie Anna.</p>

<p>&#8216;I didn&#8217;t give them time to say much,&#8217;
answered Mr. Berkeley. &#8216;The boat was starting
in a couple of hours, you see.&#8217;</p>

<p>Auntie Anna threw up her hands. &#8216;Of all
the improvident, hot-headed<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217; she was beginning,
when the change of expression in her
brother&#8217;s face silenced her. He held out his
cup to her with a pathetic look.</p>

<p>&#8216;You always forget,&#8217; he said. &#8216;Two lumps,
please.&#8217;</p>

<p>The boys flung themselves upon the sugar-basin,
and more than two lumps found their
way into his cup. Jill took the opportunity to
present Barbara&#8217;s friends to him, and Mr.
Berkeley smiled and said something genial to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325'></a>325</span>
both of them, which made Jean forget at once
how shy she was and drove away the last bit
of Angela&#8217;s confusion over her stupid mistake.
But his attention soon wandered back to his
children, and he stirred his tea and beamed
upon all three of them alternately, until the
others began to feel that they were in the way.
His eyes rested longest of all upon Babs, who
lay on her couch with an expression of complete
contentment on her face; and Auntie
Anna saw, and understood.</p>

<p>&#8216;I said all the while it was madness to write
and tell you about it,&#8217; she grumbled.</p>

<p>Mr. Berkeley chuckled. &#8216;I never got your
letter till last Wednesday week,&#8217; he said. &#8216;It
had been following me about from place to
place. Poor little Babe!&#8217; he added, pinching
her cheek softly; &#8216;what a shame to let you
knock yourself about, when your poor old
father wasn&#8217;t there to take care of you!&#8217;</p>

<p>Auntie Anna smiled grimly. &#8216;No one
could very well be less capable of taking care
of her,&#8217; she remarked.</p>

<p>Robin clambered on his father&#8217;s knee and
hugged him afresh.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why <i>did</i> you come home, father?&#8217; he
cried, raising his voice higher than ever.</p>

<p>Mr. Berkeley looked mildly surprised.
&#8216;Can&#8217;t you guess, sonny?&#8217; he asked. &#8216;Do
you suppose I could stay another minute in
somebody else&#8217;s country, when I heard that my
little girl was ill over here?&#8217;</p>

<p>Jill got up rather suddenly, and offered to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326'></a>326</span>
take Jean and Angela round the garden; and
Auntie Anna grasped her blue-knobbed cane,
and rose slowly to her feet. Before she went
off, however, she shot one more question at her
brother in her most abrupt manner. &#8216;What
about your luggage, Everard?&#8217; she demanded.
&#8216;Where have you left it?&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Berkeley reflected a moment. &#8216;I <i>think</i>
it was Boston,&#8217; he began doubtfully, &#8216;but it
may have been<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>

<p>He did not finish his sentence, for the old
lady shook her head in despair at him and
hobbled off towards the house. Barbara
watched her retreating figure, and smiled
gently to herself. Auntie Anna might pretend
as much as she liked that she was a dragon,
but nothing could prevent her looking like a
fairy godmother!</p>

<p>Her father stroked her rough, tumbled hair
caressingly, and smiled back at her.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it, Babe?&#8217; he asked.</p>

<p>The child gazed at him as he sat there, with
the two boys clinging to him as though they
would never let him go again; and the
whimsical look stole into her bright little eyes,
and lighted up the whole of her small impish
face.</p>

<p>&#8216;The magician has come back,&#8217; she said,
with a happy laugh; &#8216;and there isn&#8217;t room to
<i>move</i> in my fairy kingdom!&#8217;</p>

seen, the plant shows what there is to be seen, and the definition
follows.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
